From the beginning it is dynamic, revised, and expanded to reflect the evolution of academic thought and research, incorporating access to primary research documents and data, links to related archives, rich media, social media, and reading tools. Manifold seeks to encompass the growth and refinement of academic work as it is discussed, reviewed, and analyzed.\n\nManifold Scholarship will track a work as it is conceptualized, researched, written, and read. University of Minnesota professor of history and Press editorial board member Kevin Murphy states: \"Manifold Scholarship has the potential to transform academic publishing by giving scholars who are innovating in digital humanities the opportunity to share their research in all of its complexity, rather than to conform to traditional modes of monograph publication. The iterative approach to digital publishing allows authors to give readers access to diverse source materials to engage directly with interlocutors on sources and interpretation, thereby opening the

inquiry and writing across a whimsical para-humanities assemblage. We specialize in neo-traditional and non-conventional scholarly work that productively twists and/or ignores academic norms, with an emphasis on books that fall length-wise between the article and the monograph—id est, novellas, in one sense or another. We also take in strays. This is a space for the imp-orphans of your thought and pen, an ale-serving church for little vagabonds.\npunctum books encourages projects that profit from formal risks and possibly engage with supposedly outmoded or ‘quaint’ genres—the abcedarium, (auto)commentary, summa, bestiary, dialogue, case study, compendium, speculum/mirror, conduct manual, letter/address, apologia pro vita sua, hagiography, elegy, postcard, telegraph/telegram, inter-office memo, encyclopedia, forgery, hidden writing, source-fiction, natural history, leechbook, atlas, colloquium, colophon, commonplace book, telephone book, rolodex, field report, romance, dialogue, dream vision, catalogue, sonnet cycle, poetics, treatise, manifesto, prosody, calendar, morality play, marginalia, interlinear translation, digest, microfiche, concordance, book of hours, pastoral/eclogue, polemic, epigram, broadsheet, flyer, note-book, breviarium, collationes/collectio, book of nature, testament, proof, manual, pamphlet, miscellany, chapbook, captivity narrative, penny dreadful, testament, manual, discography, catena, liner notes, autopsy, exegesis, rule, antiphonary, legend, fax, travelogue, etymologiae, lai, excerpt, curiosity cabinet, disputation, computus, comedy of errors, soliloquy, essay, bulletin, evangeliary, gloss, meditation, fable, florilegium, myth, fairy tale, purchase order, carbon copy, transcript/transcryptum, blueprint, psalter, micrologue, lyric, daytimer, inventory, annal/chronicle, pipe roll, receipt/invoice, watch-list, charter, canon, and so on ad infinitum.

Like their earlier work, which featured the voices of women in the California State Prison system, the primary content of Blood Sugar is a voice archive compiled from painstakingly recorded interviews with participants in an HIV prevention and needle exchange program in Oakland, CA. These are voices seldom heard from the 'other\" side of this country's mendaciously named \"war on drugs.\" The project invites listeners to set aside their prejudices and assumptions in order to directly engage the stories of intravenous drug users - a public whose near total lack of self-representation has led to deep misunderstanding at best, demonization and dehumanization at worst. That said, Daniel's approach is not to \"speak for\" this population, nor is it to put forward a didactic social agenda. Like Public Secrets, Blood Sugar aims to fill a gap in the cultural discourse surrounding disenfranchised individuals and stigmatized communities by simply making their voices available to be heard. Loyer's design of the project also expands upon the algorithm-driven structure of Public Secrets, adding a dynamic visual metaphor that invites users to \"zoom in\" to follow conceptual threads or individual stories. Daniel's work, which frequently engages concepts of borders and limits, is interested in this case in the boundary - namely the skin - that separates the inside of our bodies from the outside. Users are invited to engage the project from the point of view of a surrogate for the needle that literally penetrates the surface of the skin, allowing them to delve more deeply and intimately into a given person's testimony. This subject position suggests a subtle parity between the \"user\" of the interface and the IV drug \"user\" who is, for many of us, ordinarily held at a distance if not ignored entirely. At first, the visceral pleasures of the project - keywords that glide in elliptical orbits around a pulsing nucleus - may seem antithetical to the raw struggles for survival and dignity that characterize many of the testimonies. But it is the power of the individual stories that keeps the project from becoming an exercise in voyeurism or fetishized tragedy. In the end, Blood Sugar also asks bigger questions about the role that art can and should play in highly politicized and volatile issues of personal empowerment and social justice, inviting complexity and specificity into the conversation rather than simply telling people what to think, feel or do about it.— Steve Anderson, April 4th, 2010        \\n\\\\nThe messy details of each life history then unfolded according to the syntax and grammar of the disease-and-recovery discourse learned in the kind of therapeutic setting where we met.- Sharon Daniel, Author's Statement\\n\\nAuthor's StatementIn 2000 I lived and worked in part of a converted paint factory on the bleeding-edge of a working class residential district in a part of east Oakland (California) known as 'Fruitvale\". My home was in the border zone that runs along the narrow corridor between the elevated train line and the interstate freeway. The loft complex was a kind of bunker in the midst of a post-industrial wasteland. I had moved from an apartment in San Francisco to this relatively raw space but I didn't actually need a studio with high ceilings and industrial surfaces. At that time I was engaged in the development of systems for collaborative and collective authoring online. I thought of the Internet as a public space and saw my work as 'public art,' but I was troubled by the delimitation of who and what could be considered 'Public' in this context. Every definition of \"Public\" I have found includes the phrase \"the people\". In modern European languages the phrase \"the people\" always connotes the poor, the underprivileged, and the excluded. It is a curious contradiction that this phrase simultaneously identifies the citizen or political subject (big \"P\" people), and the class that is excluded from politics - the marginalized and technologically disenfranchised. The cluster of renovated factory buildings I shared with a population of other well-educated, middle-class artists, was enclosed by a concrete wall — outside the street was strewn with shopping carts, plastic bags and discarded syringes. Gazing over that wall, while I worked in the security of my second-floor studio, I began to wonder how, or if, information technologies and public art practices could effectively create a more inclusive public sphere  one that would engage both the big \"P\" public and the little \"p\" people just outside. There was an HIV prevention program down the street that ran an open needle exchange three nights a week. I first heard about it on local radio where the non-profit's director told of a city councilman's attempt to force the exchange out of the neighborhood in an effort towards future gentrification. I believed in the efficacy of needle exchange, (albeit in an intellectual and somewhat detached way). I was intrigued by the paradoxical, outsider-subject of addiction, the borderline between dependence on licit and illicit drugs, the mystery and violence of the needle. I had reason to want to escape the privileged isolation of my own sphere  to cross over that concrete wall and into another world. This desire was sincere but also driven by curiosity, even voyeurism, and naivet. Unlike prior artists and intellectuals who have pursued research in the arena of drugs (Freud, Benjamin, Burroughs, and De Quincy), I was interested in the social and biological construction of addiction — not the experience of the drug as such. I would cross over through the point of view of the addicted subject. My desire would be satisfied by listening and observing  and the responsibility I thus assumed would be left unresolved in my unsuccessful attempts to help one of my interlocutors.I volunteered at the exchange. Eventually I started to interview people who came to the tent site to swap needles. Most of them lived on the street, had no official identification (either because they had a criminal record or no fixed address) and therefore had no access to basic civic or social services. Their absence in the data-space of the Public sphere had serious implications for them in the physical world. They were in a sense invisible - a kind of secret public.I got to know one of the women rather well  the woman that I call A____ in Blood Sugar. The needle exchange was the last frayed layer of the social safety net for someone like A____. I learned a lot from her about the third world inside the first. I learned that the realities of poverty, racism, social isolation, trauma, sexual abuse, and sex-based discrimination could make a person, even an extraordinarily intelligent person, vulnerable to addiction and psychosis. I learned a lot from A_____ about desperation and about resilience. I learned that the complex struggle over civil liberties and social rights in electronically mediated information space is materially different from the one on the street.  There is another public outside  a secret public that is simultaneously visible and invisible, and to most, illegible and incomprehensible. The men and women who spoke with me at the needle exchange, and allowed me to record our conversations, are part of this secret public. They deserve to be heard and understood. The accounts they give are not natural, objective descriptions of an unambiguous reality. No one I met at the exchange described him or herself as a righteous dopefiend. On the contrary, each self-narrative began with a kind of confession or characterization of addiction as a weakness or disease. The messy details of each life history then unfolded according to the syntax and grammar of the disease-and-recovery discourse learned in the kind of therapeutic setting where we met. But the fact that the telling is inflected by its context and social construction does not mean that the lived experience so related is any less real, or powerful, or deserving of attention. Blood Sugar presents a public record of this secret public. It provides evidence and testimony through an interface to the many hours of conversation I recorded at the needle exchange. In the interface each individual interlocutor is represented as a waveform or \"audio body\"  these audio bodies are linked together through \"parasitic\" connections revealed in their stories of pain, violence, abuse, and despair. Overall, the space these bodies inhabit and the way they are encountered by the viewer is structured in terms of the social and biological construction of addiction  at the boundary of the skin. The recorded interviews are framed by a series of texts that I have written in response to a set of somewhat rhetorical questions posed from the perspective of the Public such as \"what do we hold against the drug addict?\"  The texts incorporate my research into the neuroscience of addiction with my experience while interacting with the clients of the needle exchange. In this work I have been more of an immigrant than an artist or ethnographer — crossing over from the objective to the subjective, from expertise or authority to unauthorized alien. As an academic I was once reluctant to include my own story in my work. But my position is not neutral; in theory or in practice, that would be an impossible place. So I have crossed over into what theorists such as Jane Gallop and Michael Taussig call \"the anecdotal,\" where theorizing and storytelling, together, constitute an intervention and a refusal to accept reality as it is.It is my hope that the testimony gathered here, will challenge you, as it has summoned me, to refuse and resist the paradoxes of social exclusion and othering that attend the lives of those who suffer from poverty, alienation, and addiction.— Sharon Daniel, October 7th, 2011        \\n\\\\nLike Public Secrets, Blood Sugar aims to fill a gap in the cultural discourse surrounding disenfranchised individuals and stigmatized communities by simply making their voices available to be heard.- Steve Anderson, Editor's Introduction\\n\\nDesigner's StatementConceived of as a companion piece to our earlier collaboration Public Secrets, Blood Sugar provided Sharon Daniel and I a unique opportunity to revisit the approaches of the earlier work in light of material quite different in both its form and content. Sharon and I agreed early on that the basic aesthetic direction established in Public Secrets should remain intact. After spending some time with the recordings to be featured in Blood Sugar, however, it quickly became clear that a different approach to navigating the audio would be required. Where the statements of Public Secrets' interviewees could readily be segmented into concise utterances on particular topics, the current and former injection drug users heard in Blood Sugar demanded longer periods of sustained attention, the various stories they tell dissolving into each other in ways which resisted atomization.This continuous quality resonated with the biological element which plays such an important role in the project. Sharon's focus on the chemical proclivities of the human mind and body lent itself to the introduction of visual metaphors normally associated with medicine: each interview would become a waveform-like 'body\" annotated with statements, questions, explanations, and even numerical \"data\" measuring a given interviewee's oscillations between topics located primarily outside of the skin (social) or inside the skin (biological). The amplitude of these visual waveforms are determined not by the volume of the audio for each interview, but instead by the density of Sharon's annotations at any given time. These annotations were input into the project database using a custom tool that allowed for each piece of content to be tied to a specific point of a given interview, and for the timing of whole interview to be associated with its transcript, so users wishing to switch between listening and reading can do so without losing their place.The design process for Blood Sugar was a particularly arduous one, and a reminder of both the dangers of technological determinism and the value of face-to-face collaboration. Nintendo's Wii console was still experiencing its meteoric rise in popularity at the time we started working on this project, and I immediately set my sights on making the piece one that could be controlled both with mouse and keyboard and with the Wii remote. Sharon agreed this would be an interesting avenue to pursue, and very quickly we hit upon the idea that the remote could serve as a tactile surrogate for each audio \"body\" in the piece. Tilting the remote into different orientations would likewise rotate the currently active body/waveform, revealing different sets of annotations depending on whether the remote was pointing straight up and down, sideways, or forwards.We both became so enamored of this idea that for many months it remained an unquestioned assumption in our design process—until fifteen or so rounds of iteration made it clear that as an interface conceit it simply didn't add anything to the experience. Not long after this crisis we hit upon the much simpler visual metaphor of \"getting closer,\" a simple zoom through various stations of depth at which specific questions and content could be staged. Suddenly our visual metaphor was working with the content instead of against it, and everything quickly fell into place. As our work process for Public Secrets involved several all-day face-to-face meetings which proved extraordinarily productive in solving some of that project's thorniest design problems, we wondered how much time could have been saved if we had arranged for a few similar get-togethers during the production of Blood Sugar, as all meetings for that project took place via videoconference or phone.In the end, however, the logjam was broken, more conventional Wii remote support was added for an installation version of the project, lessons were gratefully learned, and the collaboration was no less rewarding.— Erik Loyer, October 7th, 2011        \\n","citation_source_nom":"","citation_source_url":"","date":"2012","perspectives":"","mediums":"","materiaux":"","genres":"","pays":"","collections":"vectors-journal","organisations":"","video":"https://vimeo.com/180025973/8d0e91858b#t=6826s","images":["data/cb6d7046-fe47-4380-86e2-a34f2954eeba.png"],"preview":"","plateformes":"","tags":"sociologie, dessin, audio, voix off","répertoires":"","technologies":"","description":"Like Public Secrets, Blood Sugar aims to fill a gap in the cultural discourse surrounding disenfranchised individuals and stigmatized communities by simply making their voices available to be heard.- Steve Anderson, Editor's Introduction\\n\\nEditor's IntroductionBlood Sugar operates as a companion piece to author Sharon Daniel and designer Erik Loyer's earlier, Webby award-winning Vectors project Public Secrets. Like their earlier work, which featured the voices of women in the California State Prison system, the primary content of Blood Sugar is a voice archive compiled from painstakingly recorded interviews with participants in an HIV prevention and needle exchange program in Oakland, CA. These are voices seldom heard from the 'other\" side of this country's mendaciously named \"war on drugs.\" The project invites listeners to set aside their prejudices and assumptions in order to directly engage the stories of intravenous drug users - a public whose near total lack of self-representation has led to deep misunderstanding at best, demonization and dehumanization at worst. That said, Daniel's approach is not to \"speak for\" this population, nor is it to put forward a didactic social agenda.

For the past two years, we at the journal have returned more than once to Katrina and to the cityscapes of New Orleans. We are intent both on keeping the city and its ongoing struggles in scholarly view and on exploring the possibilities for multimodal expression to capture the complex histories interlaced in what our government would have us believe was simply an act of nature.  'Blue Velvet: Re-dressing New Orleans in Katrina's Wake\" represents our most sophisticated exploration of this terrain.  Combining sound, text, photography, video, and several maps, the piece sculpts an evocative and poignant landscape that nonetheless refuses all registers of nostalgia, insisting as it does that we locate Katrina and the Crescent City among multiple trajectories of policy, memory, and representation.    While the piece proceeds via a loose linear structure, Goldberg, Hristova, and Loyer complicate this linearity via a logic of accretion and sedimentation.  Meaning shimmers and dissolves, responding to the mouse and accumulating elsewhere, asking the user to follow its twists and turns into darker places.  Words break apart but also serve to reorient us, allowing both drift and continuity.  Such an information architecture serves to reinforce key claims of the project, foregrounding the reality of, for instance, a structural racism that always seems to disappear from view, connecting the dots between life in New Orleans and the growing prison population of the United States.  As Goldberg observes, \"Incarceration has many modalities.\"       It is crucial that we continue to underscore - as \"Blue Velvet\" so powerfully does - that the tragic events that unfolded in New Orleans and along the Gulf Coast were possible precisely because of years of neoliberal policies that underwrote the necessary conditions for such devastation in the first place.  Likewise, the decision to invade Afghanistan and Iraq directly impacted ongoing efforts to repair the city's levees, with pursuit of empire trumping domestic infrastructure and safety.  Several non-profits estimate that the cost of one day of the war in Iraq for the U.S. is $220 million.  The cost of the war for one day would almost have completed the levee repairs begun in Louisiana in the years before Katrina.  The poetic pace and haunting spaces of \"Blue Velvet\" take us closer to that truth than any evening spent with CNN.— Vectors Journal Editorial Staff\\\\n\\n\\t\\n\\tBlue Velvet\\n\\tRe-dressing New Orleans in Katrina's wake\\n\\t\\nBy David Theo Goldberg & Stefka Hristova\\nDesign by Erik LoyerAuthor's StatementScholars in the Humanities have long labored under the conceit of the auteur mode of production. We are taught and reproduce the illusion that we produce our work alone, in isolation, thinking great thoughts pretty much on our own, in conversation if at all with the great works produced for the most part in this way.  Composing Blue Velvet for this issue of Vectors was a stark reminder of how wrong-headed this picture largely is. The very idea for the piece came out of a conversation with Tara McPherson. It would look nothing like it does now but for the incredible design work of Erik Loyer and cartographic shaping and mediated elaboration enabled by Stefka Hristova.  The final product is the outcome of intense weekly conversations over something like a year between the four of us about design, look, content, navigation, media, technological failures and fixes, in short, about New Orleans literally and metaphorically. But there were other inputs, exchanges, relations that helped make the piece come to life, from silent conversations with writers and artists who have felt the pulse of the Big Easy, in moments of health and illness, as well as with theoretical and political critics of neoliberalism. (For expressions of warm gratitude please consult Acknowledgment.)  The sooner we get over the conceit of solipsistic self-production, the better off the Humanities will be.But the process confirmed something more than this. Much of writing in the Humanities has tended to be linear. Without belittling the importance of this, the sort of multi-mediation that a vigorous digital forum such as Vectors makes possible shifts the linearity of rhetorical argumentation, rendering it less literal as it frees us from linearity. Vectors lives up to its name. It takes vectors seriously, encouraging connections, transversals, relationalities.  The form encourages a writing that is more fragmentary without being self-contained, open to play across dimensions, to interactivity between media, to a different kind of complexity. To mixing and mashups, made and remade. The stress on metaphoricity consequently  becomes crucial. There is, as Godard once remarked, a beginning, middle, and end, but never quite in that order. One can begin again and again, and almost anywhere; while ending one's session with the material as one sees fit.  So the writing—better, the composing and orchestration because it is never simply writing in such a forum—is in constant play with the reading, whether concretely or as possibility.  So the medium loosens the sense of absolute control.  It is as if the material writes you, rather than the reverse. The experience has been liberating, as much from the literality of the linear within the narrow constraints of one's own writing as from the tyranny of the narrowly textual more broadly. But then New Orleans will tend to have that effect on one too.— David Theo Goldberg\\\\n\\n\\t\\n\\tBlue Velvet\\n\\tRe-dressing New Orleans in Katrina's wake\\n\\t\\nBy David Theo Goldberg & Stefka Hristova\\nDesign by Erik LoyerDesigner's StatementMusic is a much more direct ancestor to interactive media than cinema. The mathematical and logical frameworks, the use of score as a generative source, the importance of live performance—all find strong parallels in digital interactivity.  Poetry, too, shares many of these qualities, and in my experience authors with a poetic sensibility are often the ones who feel the greatest sense of liberation as they engage interactive platforms.Scholars like David Theo Goldberg, who possess an innate predilection for the poetic, frequently find that their more fanciful instincts, which may be quashed in other formats, can be expressed more freely here. Of course, freedom in this medium, as in the other arts, frequently thrives within well-defined limitations. In interactive media, a good content architecture—realized in most Vectors projects in the form of a database—fulfills this role, taking account of the territory it is meant to represent and shutting down unproductive structural avenues while encouraging the fruitful ones. If all goes well, the author gains an expressive scaffold which resonates with the ideas at hand.The database design for Blue Velvet initially suffered from overconnectedness—too many kinds of things were linked in too many ways. The common result in this situation is that author and user alike become confused about what they are supposed to be doing. Stefka Hristova was instrumental in identifying these kinds of problems and suggesting solutions. Through collaborative pruning and condensing of the structure, amplified in our case by the decision to give the work a linear spine, we were able to identify and foster a regular rhythm for the interaction—an oscillation between above ground and underwater, placidity and turmoil, complacency and catastrophe.The ways in which falling words 'dissolve\" and reconfigure themselves in the piece was a structural conceit designed to give David the chance to explore something I kept hearing during our phone conversations: his penchant for wordplay. He would frequently substitute the expected word in a sentence with a similar word that threw an (often humorous) twist into the idea being expressed. Taking inspiration from this trait, I came up with a database structure that would allow David to define how words would break apart and transform. David took to the concept immediately, which was very gratifying, and resulted in some inspired word associations.A final note: Blue Velvet includes an interactive index—an experiment in making the underlying structures of Vectors projects more accessible to the public.  Using the index, you can browse the project's database visually and bookmark specific elements for citation purposes.  The piece itself remains the preferred way of accessing David's work, but we hope elements like the index and video tutorial will help to bring Vectors projects to a wider audience.— Erik Loyer","citation_source_nom":"","citation_source_url":"","date":"2007","perspectives":"","mediums":"","materiaux":"","genres":"","pays":"","collections":"vectors-journal","organisations":"","video":"https://vimeo.com/180025973/8d0e91858b#t=5568s","images":["data/3bcba21f-1eaa-4457-82c5-d287e5497bc8.png"],"preview":"","plateformes":"","tags":"?, texte, dessin, reproductions image, vidéo, carte","répertoires":"","technologies":"","description":"\\n\\t\\n\\tBlue Velvet\\n\\tRe-dressing New Orleans in Katrina's wake\\n\\t\\nBy David Theo Goldberg & Stefka Hristova\\nDesign by Erik LoyerEditor's IntroductionThis is not the first appearance of Hurricane Katrina in the databases that underwrite Vectors.

While the piece proceeds via a loose linear structure, Goldberg, Hristova, and Loyer complicate this linearity via a logic of accretion and sedimentation.  Meaning shimmers and dissolves, responding to the mouse and accumulating elsewhere, asking the user to follow its twists and turns into darker places.  Words break apart but also serve to reorient us, allowing both drift and continuity.  Such an information architecture serves to reinforce key claims of the project, foregrounding the reality of, for instance, a structural racism that always seems to disappear from view, connecting the dots between life in New Orleans and the growing prison population of the United States.  As Goldberg observes, \"Incarceration has many modalities.\"       It is crucial that we continue to underscore - as \"Blue Velvet\" so powerfully does - that the tragic events that unfolded in New Orleans and along the Gulf Coast were possible precisely because of years of neoliberal policies that underwrote the necessary conditions for such devastation in the first place.  Likewise, the decision to invade Afghanistan and Iraq directly impacted ongoing efforts to repair the city's levees, with pursuit of empire trumping domestic infrastructure and safety.  Several non-profits estimate that the cost of one day of the war in Iraq for the U.S. is $220 million.  The cost of the war for one day would almost have completed the levee repairs begun in Louisiana in the years before Katrina.  The poetic pace and haunting spaces of \"Blue Velvet\" take us closer to that truth than any evening spent with CNN.— Vectors Journal Editorial Staff\\\\n\\n\\t\\n\\tBlue Velvet\\n\\tRe-dressing New Orleans in Katrina's wake\\n\\t\\nBy David Theo Goldberg & Stefka Hristova\\nDesign by Erik LoyerAuthor's StatementScholars in the Humanities have long labored under the conceit of the auteur mode of production. We are taught and reproduce the illusion that we produce our work alone, in isolation, thinking great thoughts pretty much on our own, in conversation if at all with the great works produced for the most part in this way.  Composing Blue Velvet for this issue of Vectors was a stark reminder of how wrong-headed this picture largely is. The very idea for the piece came out of a conversation with Tara McPherson. It would look nothing like it does now but for the incredible design work of Erik Loyer and cartographic shaping and mediated elaboration enabled by Stefka Hristova.  The final product is the outcome of intense weekly conversations over something like a year between the four of us about design, look, content, navigation, media, technological failures and fixes, in short, about New Orleans literally and metaphorically. But there were other inputs, exchanges, relations that helped make the piece come to life, from silent conversations with writers and artists who have felt the pulse of the Big Easy, in moments of health and illness, as well as with theoretical and political critics of neoliberalism. (For expressions of warm gratitude please consult Acknowledgment.)  The sooner we get over the conceit of solipsistic self-production, the better off the Humanities will be.But the process confirmed something more than this. Much of writing in the Humanities has tended to be linear. Without belittling the importance of this, the sort of multi-mediation that a vigorous digital forum such as Vectors makes possible shifts the linearity of rhetorical argumentation, rendering it less literal as it frees us from linearity. Vectors lives up to its name. It takes vectors seriously, encouraging connections, transversals, relationalities.  The form encourages a writing that is more fragmentary without being self-contained, open to play across dimensions, to interactivity between media, to a different kind of complexity. To mixing and mashups, made and remade. The stress on metaphoricity consequently  becomes crucial. There is, as Godard once remarked, a beginning, middle, and end, but never quite in that order. One can begin again and again, and almost anywhere; while ending one's session with the material as one sees fit.  So the writing—better, the composing and orchestration because it is never simply writing in such a forum—is in constant play with the reading, whether concretely or as possibility.  So the medium loosens the sense of absolute control.  It is as if the material writes you, rather than the reverse. The experience has been liberating, as much from the literality of the linear within the narrow constraints of one's own writing as from the tyranny of the narrowly textual more broadly. But then New Orleans will tend to have that effect on one too.— David Theo Goldberg\\\\n\\n\\t\\n\\tBlue Velvet\\n\\tRe-dressing New Orleans in Katrina's wake\\n\\t\\nBy David Theo Goldberg & Stefka Hristova\\nDesign by Erik LoyerDesigner's StatementMusic is a much more direct ancestor to interactive media than cinema. The mathematical and logical frameworks, the use of score as a generative source, the importance of live performance—all find strong parallels in digital interactivity.  Poetry, too, shares many of these qualities, and in my experience authors with a poetic sensibility are often the ones who feel the greatest sense of liberation as they engage interactive platforms.Scholars like David Theo Goldberg, who possess an innate predilection for the poetic, frequently find that their more fanciful instincts, which may be quashed in other formats, can be expressed more freely here. Of course, freedom in this medium, as in the other arts, frequently thrives within well-defined limitations. In interactive media, a good content architecture—realized in most Vectors projects in the form of a database—fulfills this role, taking account of the territory it is meant to represent and shutting down unproductive structural avenues while encouraging the fruitful ones. If all goes well, the author gains an expressive scaffold which resonates with the ideas at hand.The database design for Blue Velvet initially suffered from overconnectedness—too many kinds of things were linked in too many ways. The common result in this situation is that author and user alike become confused about what they are supposed to be doing. Stefka Hristova was instrumental in identifying these kinds of problems and suggesting solutions. Through collaborative pruning and condensing of the structure, amplified in our case by the decision to give the work a linear spine, we were able to identify and foster a regular rhythm for the interaction—an oscillation between above ground and underwater, placidity and turmoil, complacency and catastrophe.The ways in which falling words 'dissolve\" and reconfigure themselves in the piece was a structural conceit designed to give David the chance to explore something I kept hearing during our phone conversations: his penchant for wordplay. He would frequently substitute the expected word in a sentence with a similar word that threw an (often humorous) twist into the idea being expressed. Taking inspiration from this trait, I came up with a database structure that would allow David to define how words would break apart and transform. David took to the concept immediately, which was very gratifying, and resulted in some inspired word associations.A final note: Blue Velvet includes an interactive index—an experiment in making the underlying structures of Vectors projects more accessible to the public.  Using the index, you can browse the project's database visually and bookmark specific elements for citation purposes.  The piece itself remains the preferred way of accessing David's work, but we hope elements like the index and video tutorial will help to bring Vectors projects to a wider audience.— Erik Loyer","collection":"pièces"},{"id":"cast-offs-from-the-golden-age","url":"http://vectorsjournal.org/projects/index.php?project=66","titre":"Cast-offs from the Golden Age","personnes":"Melanie Swalwell","citation":"\\n\\t\\n\\tCast-offs from the Golden Age\\n\\t\\nBy Melanie Swalwell\\nDesign by Erik LoyerEditor's IntroductionThe history of entertainment technologies, so the media and technology industries would have us believe, is best framed as a series of creative and technological triumphs, moving inexorably toward faster processing, increasingly realistic graphics and more engaging forms of interactivity. Like the film industry, game companies would probably prefer we didn't think in terms of history at all, choosing instead to situate themselves on the brink of a perpetual future, looking forward to the next big thing rather than contemplating how we got here. Heroic attempts to recapture some of the rapidly fading history of the game industry ”' from JC Herz's Joystick Nation to Van Burnham's Supercade ”\" have appeared from time to time, but usually with a focus on North American and Pacific Rim game industries and always seeking to map a comprehensive history of progress toward the present. However, the stories that historians choose to tell about the past are often inextricably entangled with their own personality quirks and idiosyncratic obsessions. If we are honest about it, the narratives we pursue probably consist of as many dead-ends, digressions and anachronies as neatly packaged elements of a grand historical narrative. It is a rare work of history that not only acknowledges this, but seeks to weave it into the fabric of the historical work itself, becoming a strength rather than a liability. So it is with Melanie Swalwell's Cast-Offs From the Golden Age, created in collaboration with Vectors Art Director Erik Loyer.In order to experience the largely unexamined history of video games in New Zealand, Swalwell asks us to retrace some of her steps ”\" and occasional missteps ”\" in seeking to discover this arcane and fragmented history. Swalwell's project refuses to deliver a comprehensive history, choosing instead to allegorize the research process by embedding bits of information within an information space. The implication is that, following Michel Foucault, all history is rightly conceived of in terms of fragmentation and partiality. The seductive narrative of the definitive, totalizing history is both mendacious and misleading. Swalwell's investigation is part exploration and part role-playing-game, as different facts reveal themselves with each traversal of the research space. Although probably a source of frustration for \"Dragnet historians\" (those hoping to receive \"just the facts\"), the rewards of engaging fully with the dynamics of Swalwell and Loyers possibility space are as formidable as that of any totalizing historical narrative.— Vectors Journal Editorial Staff\\\\n\\n\\t\\n\\tCast-offs from the Golden Age\\n\\t\\nBy Melanie Swalwell\\nDesign by Erik LoyerAuthor's StatementIn 2004, I was invited to undertake background research for a museum exhibition 'GamePLAY\", on the history, art and science of digital gaming in New Zealand.  I was to focus on finding the New Zealand dimension and/or context for each of these areas, something that presented a challenge for me as an outsider: I didn't have my own experiences or knowledge gained from growing up with this history happening around me, in this place, and it was sometimes tricky to sort out the quite understandable desire to have a local focus, from any inclination towards national exceptionalism.  This stipulation, however, turned out to be something of a gift.  Had I not been required to look into these New Zealand specific questions, it is unlikely that I would have pursued the overlaps between the local and the non-local -- issues such as the dates that particular international games systems arrived in New Zealand -- to the extent that I did.  What I found was that there were significant differences between the accepted accounts of games history -- typically told from U.S. or Japanese perspectives -- and the history of digital games in a place like New Zealand.  Researching a history of a place distant from these 'centres' offers the opportunity to realign some of the taken for granted 'facts' or references in surprising, and sometimes quirky, ways.  Two quick examples serve to illustrate how different things look when viewed from the 'periphery'.  \"The crash\" is a well-known games history phrase, referring to the 1983 downturn in the industry.  In New Zealand, however, \"the crash\" is almost always a reference to the 1987 stock market crash, which had significant implications for the country, and sent a number of companies -- including some involved in videogame production -- under.  And although Atari was in serious trouble in the U.S. in 1983, New Zealanders didn't discover the delights of the 2600/7800 systems -- released in the U.S. in 1977 -- until the mid 1980s, when the stock was likely dumped here cheaply.Setting out to search for material pertaining to the local situation, I quickly found that there was little standard textual material on the subject, and even less in the way of material artefacts housed in New Zealand cultural institutions.  This meant that I had to get creative and innovate as far as research methods were concerned. Ephemera collections quickly proved to be one of the best sources of information about games in New Zealand: the bits and pieces that many people wouldn't consider worthwhile, stuff like old advertising catalogues that is usually discarded, yielded a wealth of rich, primary source material.  Asking people I knew and met what their history with digital games was, also proved useful.  Often, people I approached doubted that they would know anything of significance, but sometimes what they would tell would introduce new angles or even whole areas that I hadn't realised I needed to inquire about.  (This was also one of the great joys of visiting paper-based ephemera collections: their ability to seduce and productively pull one off course.)  Over time, snippets from one conversation have become meaningful in the context of others.  One of the best sources, of both ephemera and personal knowledge has, of course, been private game collectors, those individuals with the foresight to collect what the rest of us throw away.\"Castoffs from the Golden Age\" utilises samples of the ephemera I have sourced from both public and private collections, together with a range of other fragments to reconstruct and dramatise the research process for the user.   The user is invited to step into the shoes of the researcher, seeking after information that will allow them to achieve their goals.  Of course, research isn't only about completing goals: also part of the process and the experience are the moments of excitement at a serendipitous discovery, the frustration at dead ends or confusion at knock backs received, a wondering about where to turn next, or the sense that there are just too many avenues of inquiry to pursue.  Finally, there is the interpretive work of piecing together fragments gleaned from a range of sources.  To have been able to experiment with analogues between a researcher's process of conducting research and making sense of the resultant information, and the experience of users of multimedia has been one of the great pleasures of this project.To conclude, a few reflections on the computer in all this are warranted.  In the summer of 2005, I trialled using a qualitative software package to keep track of the very many sources, pieces of information and insights, and how they were linked, because sometimes there is just too much to keep in one's head.  Though the promise of the computer as aide memoire is enticing, I found my commitment to entering every piece of data didn't last long: I realised that it was no guarantee against my forgetting the (for me) all-important links between various fragments and ideas, and though having them stored in a computer was comforting, it didn't speed up the process of my working them through.  I know this now about my practice, nevertheless, it was an interesting exercise and one that brought the figure of interlinked nodes vividly to life for me.  I also know now that even when I forget one of these links or a piece of information, it is likely that I will come back to it, if by a different path, owing to the rich network of connections of which it is a part.  By contrast, I like very much that we have not presented the many disparate ideas and fragments of which this piece is comprised in this way, as a highly structured and interlinked series of nodes.  Rather, it is individual users who will bring these nodes and built up networks forth, via the resonances they feel, the sense they make, and the connections they draw as they navigate the work.— Melanie Swalwell\\\\n\\n\\t\\n\\tCast-offs from the Golden Age\\n\\t\\nBy Melanie Swalwell\\nDesign by Erik LoyerDesigner's StatementFrom the beginning, Melanie Swalwell was interested in making 'Cast-offs from the Golden Age\" an experience that would be eloquent of the ambiguities and loose ends of the research process.  Ambiguity doesn't \"just happen\" in digital interactivity, however--it must be constructed out of well-defined structural elements which are fine enough in resolution to enable fluid recombination, yet coarse enough to signify recognizable ideas.  The process, as a result, is thoroughly counter-intuitive with respect to its objective.A project like \"Cast-offs\" is heavily database-driven for a number of reasons, the most important of which is the organic quality which a dynamic content storage medium lends the entire process.  We aim to create original works for Vectors, not adaptations, and as such the writing (and rewriting) process must happen concurrently with the design and programming--a tight feedback loop between the three is essential if the final piece is to be truly responsive to the demands of the medium.The database, of course, must be designed, and it can be a challenging process--essentially the task is to create a rough (very rough) analogue to the concepts and ideas a scholar has been developing over the course of many years. Furthermore, since in this case the process was being applied not just to a conceptual framework Melanie had developed, but to her own lived experience as a researcher, she had all the justification in world to reject the crude, rigid abstraction of life represented by the database design.Fortunately, this proved not to be the case, and Melanie gamely threw herself into the formidable task of translating her experience and work into the rows, columns and relations of the database, enabled by our excellent data entry tools engineered by Craig Dietrich, tools which adapt instantly to changes in the structure of the database and greatly enhance the fluidity of our development process.One of the joys of a project like this is reaching the point at which all the analysis and categorization involved in the design process gives way to the constructive and creative activities of experience-building.  At some point one's fluency both with the tools and with the emerging characteristics of the system being built become subconscious to the point where the rightness or wrongness of a particular element can be intuited.  Many thanks to Melanie and to all the scholars we work with for being open enough to an unfamiliar process to allow those moments to occur.Further, I would like to thank Chad Corbin for making available his quaternion math ActionScript for 3D calculations, and my father, George Loyer, for helping me troubleshoot my modifications to the code.— Erik Loyer","citation_source_nom":"","citation_source_url":"","date":"2006","perspectives":"","mediums":"","materiaux":"","genres":"","pays":"","collections":"vectors-journal","organisations":"","video":"https://vimeo.com/180025973/8d0e91858b#t=2404s","images":["data/dd026597-27a7-4906-8f09-6619935f9c61.png"],"preview":"","plateformes":"","tags":"histoire, texte, modélisation 3D","répertoires":"","technologies":"","description":"\\n\\t\\n\\tCast-offs from the Golden Age\\n\\t\\nBy Melanie Swalwell\\nDesign by Erik LoyerEditor's IntroductionThe history of entertainment technologies, so the media and technology industries would have us believe, is best framed as a series of creative and technological triumphs, moving inexorably toward faster processing, increasingly realistic graphics and more engaging forms of interactivity.

Smith","citation":"Digital expression is well understood as a realm of promiscuous substitution, in which signifiers can take any shape or size and cultural work can be accomplished by mashing up disparate sign systems.- Erik Loyer, Designer's Statement\\n\\nEditor's IntroductionOne of the tactics of contemporary critical practice relies on a very simple act, namely the mash-up in which at least two usually disparate elements are brought together and we witness the often serendipitous and surprising mix that results. So it is with Greg Smith's Critical Sections, which unites architecture and cinema, specifically the domestic spaces of architecture and several iconic domestic spaces from movies, to ponder the city of Los Angeles through the emergence of new narrative spaces as they are conjured by the project's user. Certainly the union of architecture and cinema is nothing new. And indeed, Smith points to the influence of Bernard Tschumi's project The Manhattan Transcripts and its own blending of architecture and cinema. However, part of what is fascinating about Smith's collaboration with designer Erik Loyer is the creation of an improvisational space for realizing these connections. Moving several steps beyond the linear structure of conventional scholarly writing, Critical Sections allows users to explore, play and recombine elements from a visually rich palette of possibilities. Also of note here are the historiographical implications of Smith's project. As a contribution to the Memory issue of Vectors, Critical Sections proceeds from an already problematized approach to both history and remembering. As cultural historian Norman Klein (who wrote the project's peer response) has long argued, Los Angeles is a city notorious for its troubled relationship to the past, in no small part due to the omnipresence of the film and television industries. Architecture in Los Angeles likewise seems constantly to be in the process of reinventing itself, erasing past styles, buildings, even entire neighborhoods. But as Klein points out, Critical Sections is engaged not with the city of Los Angeles that is inhabited by real people of extraordinary economic, social and ethnic diversity, but with the 'L.A.\" that emerges from an amalgam of fact, fiction, memory, dreams and imagination. Where are the bounds between real and imagined histories in a city such as this? And what is the proper form for thinking critically about the city and its past. In addressing such a well-worn topic that has already been theorized, criticized and historicized by some of today's most esoteric and incisive thinkers, Smith and Loyer manage to create a point of entry to thinking about the city that is both fresh and imaginative.— Steve Anderson, December 10th, 2008        \\n\\\\nWhile the majority of the houses discussed have been built and exist in Los Angeles, since we are not residents of these spaces we can never truly understand these structures outside photography or architectural tourism.- Greg J. Smith, Author's Statement\\n\\nAuthor's Statement'Books of architecture as opposed to books about architecture, develop their own existence and logic. They are not directed at illustrating buildings or cities, but at searching for the ideas that underlie them. Inevitably, their content is given rhythm by the turning of pages, by the time and motion this suggests. The books may read as sequences, but they do not necessarily imply narratives.\"Bernard Tschumi wrote the above statement to contextualize his seminal drawing project The Manhattan Transcripts, which was first exhibited in 1978 and consolidated as a publication in 1981. This experimental work abstracted the skyline and street grid of New York City into a framework through which he storyboarded a series of spatial and cinematic scenarios. The project interrogated the conventions of architectural drawing and co-opted them towards the creation of an idiosyncratic and dynamic narrative.Critical Sections is a reconsideration of the methodology of The Manhattan Transcripts in light of hypermedia and database culture. This project puts Los Angeles under the microscope and proposes a dissection and reconstruction of sixteen notable representations of life in the city. Instead of focusing on the cityscape, Critical Sections looks to private residence as a cipher for reading the built environment in Los Angeles. Drawings of eight prototype homes, \"idealized\" dwellings, have been combined with stills and sequences from eight films set in, or explicitly about the city. Each of these assemblages provides an idiosyncratic focus around which to arrange a body of pertinent references on cinematic and residential space. The resulting index is a dense constellation of fragments that merges text with image and fiction with concrete reality to construct a new narrative space, an archive for thoughts, observations and commentary on domesticity in Los Angeles.It is not without irony that fictional representations figure so prominently into this work. While the majority of the houses discussed have been built and exist in Los Angeles, since we are not residents of these spaces we can never truly understand these structures outside photography or architectural tourism. As viewers, we are similarly estranged from the version(s) of the city that are depicted in narrative cinema. This project capitalizes on the tension between our familiarity with and alienation from these shared memories and positions them as reconfigurable elements, the base material of this examination of residential space in Los Angeles.— Greg J. Smith, May 19th, 2008        \\n\\\\nThe resulting index is a dense constellation of fragments that merges text with image and fiction with concrete reality to construct a new narrative space, an archive for thoughts, observations and commentary on domesticity in Los Angeles.- Greg J.

So it is with Greg Smith's Critical Sections, which unites architecture and cinema, specifically the domestic spaces of architecture and several iconic domestic spaces from movies, to ponder the city of Los Angeles through the emergence of new narrative spaces as they are conjured by the project's user. Certainly the union of architecture and cinema is nothing new. And indeed, Smith points to the influence of Bernard Tschumi's project The Manhattan Transcripts and its own blending of architecture and cinema. However, part of what is fascinating about Smith's collaboration with designer Erik Loyer is the creation of an improvisational space for realizing these connections. Moving several steps beyond the linear structure of conventional scholarly writing, Critical Sections allows users to explore, play and recombine elements from a visually rich palette of possibilities. Also of note here are the historiographical implications of Smith's project. As a contribution to the Memory issue of Vectors, Critical Sections proceeds from an already problematized approach to both history and remembering. As cultural historian Norman Klein (who wrote the project's peer response) has long argued, Los Angeles is a city notorious for its troubled relationship to the past, in no small part due to the omnipresence of the film and television industries. Architecture in Los Angeles likewise seems constantly to be in the process of reinventing itself, erasing past styles, buildings, even entire neighborhoods. But as Klein points out, Critical Sections is engaged not with the city of Los Angeles that is inhabited by real people of extraordinary economic, social and ethnic diversity, but with the 'L.A.\" that emerges from an amalgam of fact, fiction, memory, dreams and imagination. Where are the bounds between real and imagined histories in a city such as this? And what is the proper form for thinking critically about the city and its past. In addressing such a well-worn topic that has already been theorized, criticized and historicized by some of today's most esoteric and incisive thinkers, Smith and Loyer manage to create a point of entry to thinking about the city that is both fresh and imaginative.— Steve Anderson, December 10th, 2008        \\n\\\\nWhile the majority of the houses discussed have been built and exist in Los Angeles, since we are not residents of these spaces we can never truly understand these structures outside photography or architectural tourism.- Greg J. Smith, Author's Statement\\n\\nAuthor's Statement'Books of architecture as opposed to books about architecture, develop their own existence and logic. They are not directed at illustrating buildings or cities, but at searching for the ideas that underlie them. Inevitably, their content is given rhythm by the turning of pages, by the time and motion this suggests. The books may read as sequences, but they do not necessarily imply narratives.\"Bernard Tschumi wrote the above statement to contextualize his seminal drawing project The Manhattan Transcripts, which was first exhibited in 1978 and consolidated as a publication in 1981. This experimental work abstracted the skyline and street grid of New York City into a framework through which he storyboarded a series of spatial and cinematic scenarios. The project interrogated the conventions of architectural drawing and co-opted them towards the creation of an idiosyncratic and dynamic narrative.Critical Sections is a reconsideration of the methodology of The Manhattan Transcripts in light of hypermedia and database culture. This project puts Los Angeles under the microscope and proposes a dissection and reconstruction of sixteen notable representations of life in the city. Instead of focusing on the cityscape, Critical Sections looks to private residence as a cipher for reading the built environment in Los Angeles. Drawings of eight prototype homes, \"idealized\" dwellings, have been combined with stills and sequences from eight films set in, or explicitly about the city. Each of these assemblages provides an idiosyncratic focus around which to arrange a body of pertinent references on cinematic and residential space. The resulting index is a dense constellation of fragments that merges text with image and fiction with concrete reality to construct a new narrative space, an archive for thoughts, observations and commentary on domesticity in Los Angeles.It is not without irony that fictional representations figure so prominently into this work. While the majority of the houses discussed have been built and exist in Los Angeles, since we are not residents of these spaces we can never truly understand these structures outside photography or architectural tourism. As viewers, we are similarly estranged from the version(s) of the city that are depicted in narrative cinema. This project capitalizes on the tension between our familiarity with and alienation from these shared memories and positions them as reconfigurable elements, the base material of this examination of residential space in Los Angeles.— Greg J.

Schnapp\\nEditor's IntroductionOn Saturday, March 25, 2006, over 500,000 supporters of immigration rights took to the streets of downtown Los Angeles, staging one of the largest demonstrations in recent U.S. history.  Outraged by extreme anti-immigration legislation under consideration in Congress, this confluence of individuals came together in a peaceful protest that gave physical presence to the growing political power of Latinos in the United States.  By Sunday, most physical traces of that particular crowd had vanished, even as new crowds coalesced in a wave of similar marches across the country in the weeks that followed, including another gathering of half a million in Dallas on April 10th.  Yet even as the crowds dispersed, images of the protests graced the front pages of every major newspaper in the country, and Congress, at least temporarily, suspended action on anti-immigrant legislation.  The power and scale of the gatherings inscribed the national imaginary.  Thus, force and tenuousness limn twin functions of the crowd, mapping over its simultaneous status as at once ephemeral and iconic.  Indeed, the iconicity of the crowd as emblematic of modernity may track quite closely to the crowd's ephemeral and emergent nature.Undertaken as a multi-year research project of the Stanford Humanities Lab, Crowds productively considers these and other aspects of the crowd as a powerful cultural, political, and historical phenomenon.  The site brings together an extensive database of writings, images, sound files, videos, and other artifacts in order to query whether or not, following Gustave Le Bon, we still live in 'the era of crowds\".  Across the many points of view offered in the site (and in the ancillary materials that form the larger project), Crowds allows us to slice through various takes on how such public gatherings emerge and, more importantly, on how they function.  The project also explores the degree to which crowds evince a tension between the one and the many, the individual and the mass.  In one of the site's 'testimonies', Michael Hardt distinguishes the multitude from the crowd, noting that \"the concept of the multitude is meant to name a set of singularities,\" while the crowd often slips into the faceless mob or mass.  In its very structure, in its lines and grids, Crowds draws upon this notion of singularity within unity, creating a rich, multi-perspectival investigation of public gatherings that at once respects the macro and the micro, the one and the many.  Its bits and pieces, its individual players (from the furrowed brow of that marcher from Selma to the catty commentary of Jessica Burnstein), remain distinct even while they collectively paint a larger picture.  The project stages an intermedial and transdisciplinary approach to its subject matter that simultaneously functions as a model of expanded scholarship, translating the work of the academy for broader public consumption, both on the internet and in various museum settings.  Finally, in its invitation to curate a new gallery or add a new testimony, Crowds also creates a possible space for public dialogue, inviting someone to tell the stories of the anti-immigration protests that are unfolding as I type.— Vectors Journal Editorial Staff\\\\n\\n\\t\\n\\tCrowds\\n\\t\\nBy Jeffrey T. Schnapp\\nAuthor's StatementCrowds is both the name of a research project carried out within the Stanford Humanities Lab in 2000-2005 and the title of a Flash-based website that serves as a bridge and space of overlap between the two other principal project outputs: a Crowds book (Stanford University Press, 2006) and Revolutionary Tides: The Art of the Political Poster 1914-1989, an exhibition and accompanying catalogue (Skira, 2005). All three are dedicated to exploring the decisive roles played by human multitudes in politics, society, and culture, with particular emphasis on the modern era of crowds, from the revolutions of the eighteenth century to the present.How did early sociologists and psychologists understand processes of group action and reasoning? How have modern artists and writers translated abstract notions like 'the collective will\" and \"popular sovereignty\" into visual or narrative terms? How do the vocabularies employed to describe crowds shape and find themselves shaped by the sociohistorical contexts in which they gain currency? What sort of roles do media play in shaping images and myths of the collectivity? How do modern multitudes resemble or differ from their premodern counterparts? How have modern concepts of individualism and identity been altered by the rise of mass-based societies? Do we still live in what Gustave Le Bon famously proclaimed in his 1898 Psychology of Crowds as \"the era of crowds\"?These are the sorts of questions that the website addresses in three distinct but integrated sections. The entry section ('Crowds') contains four main categories of materials: virtual galleries curated by scholars and artists on various facets of crowds and modern life; reference entries on founding figures in the social sciences whose work has shaped the modern understanding of crowds; semantic histories, case studies of individual words in a dozen languages from ancient Greek to modern Chinese, and of their historical evolution; and a constellation of mini-essays in the form of testimonies regarding crowd experiences by contemporary writers and thinkers. The second section ('Revolutionary Tides') provides a virtual counterpart to the experience of the exhibition, allowing the visitor to experience the same objects and object clusters in sequence, as well as providing in-depth documentation regarding individual posters. It is also accompanied by a documentary film (Art in Propaganda); an interview with East German poster artist Wolfgang Janisch; documentation regarding the 1/3rd scale reconstructions of several agitprop stations designed by the Russian Constructivist Gustav Klucis in 1922, featured in the exhibition installation; information regarding the catalogue and press coverage; and five video captures of actual visitor experiences of the inaugural version of the show.The third section is entitled 'Crowds intermedia' and contains lead sections from the book's essays plus a bonus essay on the student protests of May 1968 (all in the form of pdf's); the Crowds Library, a searchable database that makes available to contemporary readers a wide array of social science writings on crowds from 1850-1927 in England, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, and the United States; and a streaming video version of the Crowds seminar, held on November 4-5, 2006 at the Stanford Humanities Lab. Whereas much of the book, exhibition, and website are historical in focus, the seminar was concerned with the present and future of crowds. Speculative in character, it assumed the form of an open conversation among artists, political activists, humanities scholars, social scientists, and technologists.The Crowds project was one of the Stanford Humanities Lab's five flagship \"Big Humanities\" projects dating back to 2000. From the outset, the project's heuristic hypotheses were as follows:a) that the era of popular sovereignty, industrialization, and urbanization saw the rise of a constellation of new forms of mass assembly and collective social action that, born in the eighteenth century, reached their apogee in the first half of the twentieth century;b) that these forms began to attenuate gradually in the second half of the century, due to the proliferation and ever increasing prevalence of virtual or media-based forms of assembly over physical assemblies in industrial/postindustrial societies, as well as to long-term trends promoting economic decentralization, suburban sprawl, increased mobility, and political disengagement; and c) that this shift, rather than abolishing the equation between crowds and modernity, has reshaped it, channeling experiences of crowding in postindustrial societies into certain limited domains of civic and electoral ritual, entertainment, and leisure, while assigning to large-scale mass political actions a fallback function restricted to times of exception (war, acute social conflicts, and the like). The initial project thesis was less one of rupture than of a process of specialization whose ultimate outcome is a gradual reduction of the role of physical crowds to that of an icon that circulates within a political economy characterized by the coexistence of media aggregation and bodily disaggregation. The icon in question is subject to a variety of uses and appropriations; its currency is sustained by contemporary resurgences of the prior history of marches, rallies, riots, and assemblies. It tends, however, to appear under an ever deepening patina of otherness and anachronism: \"otherness\" inasmuch as the face of contemporary multitudes has increasingly become a foreign face associated with conflicts in Asia, the Middle East, and Africa relayed into first-world living rooms and bedrooms via electronic media; \"anachronism\" to the degree that, even in the developing world, contemporary mass actions appear to have become ever more \"citational\" — they quote from a prior, now irrecuperable heroic era of crowds — or designed for media audiences in remote locations — hence the prevalence of banners in English in non-Anglophone settings. The result is a growing decoupling of the once solid equation between crowds and contemporaneity. By means of its rich stratification of contents, modes of discourse, media, methologies, and voices, the Crowds website seeks to explore the above terrain in a manner that weds macro- with microhistory, a solid and rigorous informational infrastructure with a no less rigorous critical and interpretive superstructure.— Jeffrey T.

In many ways, the pioneering effort of the Labyrinth Project helped to create the space from which Vectors might emerge, and we are pleased to be able to present this sample of their work.  It raised for us interesting questions about the status of the \"excerpt\" in the digital age, for selecting a portion of a digital project for reproduction is not the same as publishing a chapter of a book.  Nonetheless, much as a book chapter functions as a lure for the larger project, we hope that this selection from Cultivating Pasadena encourages you to learn more about the Labyrinth Project.— Vectors Journal Editorial Staff\\\\n\\n\\t\\n\\tCultivating Pasadena\\n\\tFrom Roses to Redevelopment\\n\\t\\nBy The Labyrinth Project\\nDesigner's StatementPasadena: An Experiment in Time Travel– Rosemary Comella, Creative Director/DesignerIf the old adage 'a picture is worth a thousand words\" holds true, then perhaps two pictures of the same place taken decades apart are worth exponentially more, for they offer us insights into a community's development in a particularly visual way. The exhibition phase of Cultivating Pasadena explored this premise, dramatizing the city's development from the end of the 19th Century to the present. The exhibition and its components functioned as an interactive time machine not only featuring \"then and now\" photographs but also presenting historians, experts and \"aficionados\" including Claire Bogaard, Lee Silver, Kevin Starr, Karen Stokes and Robert Winter speaking on topics ranging from architecture, freeways and geography to culture, race and community. This material was exhibited at The Pasadena Museum of California Art through a transmedia network that included a large screen interactive projection, printed catalog and 25 pairs of \"before and after\" photographs. The excerpt displayed here, as part of Vectors, is a sample of an extensive DVD-ROM produced in conjunction with the exhibition. Currently, the Labyrinth Project and the Pasadena Museum of California Art are proposing a second phase for the project that will expand its interactive potential and degree of community participation. This second phase, Cultivating Pasadena II: From Personal Stories to Homegrown History, will be built around the community's contributions and responses to the city as it is and the city as it was--personal histories and collections entwined with a collective past.  Residents, preservationists, enthusiasts and schools, among others, will be invited to collect oral histories, photographs, home movies, and memorabilia for another exhibition and website. The following is a description of the production of  Cultivating Pasadena: From Roses to Redevelopment  Cultivating Pasadena stems from an earlier digital project, entitled Bleeding Through Layers of Los Angeles, 1920-1986, that simultaneously investigates the history of downtown Los Angeles and the nature of storytelling itself.1 While both projects involve rephotography, Cultivating Pasadena relies more heavily on this practice as a way of chronicling the evolving urban landscape. In the course of showing Bleeding Through to audiences, my co-creators and I noted that the digital cross-dissolves between vintage archival photographs and contemporary color views of the same urban scene elicited particular pleasure. This project is, in part, a response to that reaction and further inquiry into its cause.What is the source of this pleasure? Perhaps it is because in one visual moment we solve one mystery as another is uncovered. Now that we know what the site looked like from one point in time to another, are we then compelled to imagine how and why a site has changed so drastically or so little? What are the forces that transform a site from rural to urban, from well-tended and occupied to neglected and abandoned, from Victorian to modern? And what are the forces that keep something preserved? As one of the photographers on the Bleeding Through project, I began to think of rephotography as a form of time travel linking one point in time to another. It is also a form of time-lapse photography, demonstrating the passage of time while remaining in the same place, revealing cultural and physical changes that we may otherwise never see. More profoundly it demonstrates the existential nature of space and time - the disappearance of memory, the impermeability of things.Selecting the images to be rephotographed can be a challenging undertaking, particularly when trying to encapsulate the major characteristics of how a place developed over time. When I first browsed the on-line collection of the Automobile Club of Southern California looking for archival images of downtown Los Angeles for Bleeding Through, I was struck by how such mundane intentions, the documentation of road safety or traffic conditions, had often resulted in capturing something sublime. While a pristine Ansel Adams photograph of the moon over Half Dome demands that we view it in a particularly romantic way, the Automobile Club images had a refreshing unselfconsciousness. They provided a seemingly unadulterated look into the past that caught the unposed, the spontaneous, the inconsequential details that lend authenticity to a scene. In rephotographing Pasadena, we again returned to the collection of the Automobile Club (now our collaborators), looking for such representations of the city's past.This search proved more difficult than our team (Matt Roth and Morgan Yates of the Automobile Club and Marsha Kinder, Karen Voss and myself of the Annenberg Center) had first imagined. Now, rather than simply looking for something intangible that expressed the feel of the street, we needed a broad range of images that would chronicle Pasadena's unique development. While the Automobile Club's collection is stunning in its quality, its focus on transportation and planning necessitated that we explore additional archives - such as those belonging to USC, the Pasadena Museum of History, the Los Angeles Public Library, Caltech, and finally the California State Library - in order to represent other themes. As the prints were to be exhibited, we looked for archival photographs that contained fine detail and a wide tonal range. In some cases, however, this technical prerequisite was overridden by the desire to retain images that contained significant traces of the past - early prints so many generations removed from their original negative that they simultaneously preserve and erase the past. Although the selection process was methodical, a number of factors made it somewhat arbitrary - which archives we were able to access, how much time and money we had, the limitation on the number of prints to be exhibited and last but not least our personal aesthetic preferences. Thus the final selection of twenty-five pairs of photographs is far from exhaustive.The next step in our process involved a combination of detective work and location scouting, for the selection of images had to be narrowed to those sites we could re-find.2  We followed clues - the name of a residence, street names, a recognizable geological area, or urban landmark. Often, Lian Partlow, archivist from the Pasadena Museum of History, or some longtime resident, offered invaluable assistance in identifying a depicted site. Once we had a probable location, I then went there to take a series of digital shots that we would use to determine if it was indeed the correct location, and if it should be included as part of the exhibition prints. Some sites, I could not verify. Sometimes I sought out several photographs of the same site to help figure out, for example, whether a disappeared mansion sat facing Orange Grove Avenue or was set back from the road. I took many more photographs than would be included in the final twenty-five pairs, in part, because I was curious. Many of these additional images are included in the interactive DVD-ROM.Rephotography is an idiosyncratic way of getting to know a locale, a little like playing detective or archaeologist. What will be uncovered? A crime scene (in which something beautiful has been replaced by something hideous), an act of preservation, an improvement, or just a progression? Along with the challenge of simply finding the locations, these questions drove me out into Pasadena, day after day. Looking at so many images of Pasadena throughout its history was like trying to get acquainted with someone by paging through their family albums. After I had walked the streets and highways, entered buildings, climbed around the Arroyo, discovered the obvious panoramas, and met people from the Pasadena area, little by little, our selection grew and changed.Discovering more than 3,000 photographs by Frederick Martin in the California State Library collection, mostly depicting the San Gabriel Valley, also changed our selection. Well-composed, straightforward photographs taken between 1910 and 1930, they document much of Pasadena's landscape and architecture. Their sheer volume is compelling. Now not only did I speculate about Pasadena's past but also about Martin's reasons for thoroughly documenting so many of Pasadena's houses and gardens. According to Gary Kurutz, photography archivist in charge of this collection, little is known of Martin except that he settled in Pasadena at the turn of the century and began working for Kohler Photo Studio on Colorado Boulevard in 1902. He later took over the establishment, renaming it the Martin Studio. Martin died in 1949. Six of the photographs in the exhibition and book are by Martin, and many more of his images are found in the DVD-ROM. After the digital scouting, I began the analog photography using either a 4 x 5-inch large-format camera or a 6 x 9-cm medium-format camera. During these sessions, if the situation permitted, I tried to take my photograph at approximately the same time of day and from the same point of view as the original but using color film. (Rephotographing in color works well for cross-dissolves because it gives the viewer enough distinction between the archival and contemporary images to perceive where one begins and the other ends.) Street-widening and incredible tree growth made precision difficult in reconstructing some shots. At certain sites, little if anything of the original composition remained. For example, the Carr House and its surrounding Carmelita Park are now the location of the Norton Simon Museum. Although it was difficult to situate the Victorian homestead precisely, the transformation of a site created by one of Pasadena's early cultural patrons into a modern art museum suggests thematic continuity. In place of the once-massive Moorish-themed Universalist Church, a lone palm tree now stands, its trunk echoing the disappeared church tower. In rephotographing an early agricultural landscape taken from Monk Hill featuring the San Gabriel Mountains, I shot a wider view, letting the playground of Washington Middle School occupy more of the frame. In changing the framing I hoped to expand the notion of rephotography from an exact science for measuring physical changes to an interpretative tool for examining such cultural phenomena as land use and urban development. Showing what is beyond the periphery of the original view is one way to contextualize the images. That intention motivates Karen Voss's essay, Cultivating Pasadena, and is a primary aim of the interactive DVD-ROM. Designed to be a kind of \"vision machine,\" the DVD-ROM not only performs the cross-dissolves but also provides the viewer with other materials from our inquiry that might enrich the comparison between past and present. It includes the videotaped interviews of Pasadenans, quotes from experts and \"aficionados,\" as well as excerpts from period films and contemporary videos. From these multiple visual and intellectual perspectives on Pasadena's development, viewers can pursue their own investigations, driven by curiosity and chance.During my exploration of Pasadena, I encountered many knowledgeable people who were eager to help me uncover, in the contemporary landscape, the original views found in these archival photographs. Quite by accident I met Tim Brick of the Arroyo Seco Foundation, whose website I had been exploring (www.arroyoseco.org.) He was walking his dog along the Arroyo and wondered whether I was photographing an Oak tree that the city wanted to cut down. Some were protesting its destruction. Actually, I was trying to figure out the vantage point of a turn-of-the-century photograph of the Arroyo Seco before the Colorado Bridge was built. He joined me in searching for this view and told me where I could find other photographs of the Arroyo. In trying to locate one amazing Gothic-looking mansion dating from the turn-of-the-century, which I deduced had been located near the intersection of Pasadena and Arlington Avenues, I met a tenant in a house owned by Caltrans. She explained that Caltrans owned her unrestored home (a rarity in Pasadena) and all the others in that historic neighborhood due to a right-of-way battle to connect the 710 to the 210 Freeway. This battle had been going on for more than fifty years. On a subsequent visit, I met another woman who actually remembered the mansion, telling me precisely where it once stood and of its deterioration into an eerie run-down place that frightened the neighborhood children, including her. I went repeatedly to Washington Middle School, drawn by its fabulous location on Monk Hill. Teachers, custodians, administrators, and vice-principal, Robert Tanous, allowed me to use the windows and roofs of their buildings as lookout points from which to make photographs. There I stumbled upon one landscape view that I had been hunting for days: the setting for the original Washington School, built in 1884 and now gone. This school on Monk Hill came to symbolize for me the future of Pasadena, as a harmonious and ethnically diverse population nestled within a stunning landscape. While searching for the site of reputedly the first house built in Pasadena in February 1874, by early founding father Albert O. Bristol, I met Frank Burkard, Sr., of Burkard Nursery. We surmised that his nursery, on the southwest corner of Lincoln and Orange Grove, is located next to where the Bristol \"honeymoon cottage\" must have stood. Although Burkard did not recall the cottage (pictured in our book), he did remember the Victorian house that Bristol had built next door in 1888. The cottage burned down in 1936 (a year before Burkard's father opened the nursery) and the Victorian house, of which I could not find a photograph, was most likely torn down in the late 1960s. In its place is a commercial complex that includes, among other community services, the NAACP. There I met Janet Akosua Edge, a charter member of the branch in Altadena since 1984, who also grew up in this neighborhood. Her recollections begin around 1957 when this part of North Pasadena was a self-contained African-American enclave with its own caterers, churches, childcare, library, barbershops, mortuaries, parks, schools, and stores. The dismantling of this large, closely knit community coincided, she felt,  with the construction of the Jackie Robinson Center built in 1974 on the east and west sides of North Fair Oaks. Presented as a benefit to the community, she sensed it was really a diversionary tactic that allowed developers to maneuver long-time residents out of their bungalows, cottages and Victorians in preparation for further improvements that never materialized. She graciously agreed to be interviewed about this neighborhood for the Cultivating Pasadena project.Many residents were especially accommodating. Volunteer gardeners at the Lummis house trimmed away foliage from a tree so that a little more of this stone masterpiece could be captured. Two residents above Devil's Gate Dam allowed me to wander their property several times looking for just the right view. While scouting Bungalow Heaven, one interested owner on Claremont Street suggested the best of Martin's images to rephotograph was the bungalow with the children in front of it, two doors down. When I asked to photograph the famous Blacker House, its owners Dr. Ellen Knell and Mr. Harvey Knell, who are inundated with such requests, kindly agreed. We also sought out people. Dennis Crowley, a historian and bike enthusiast who is leading an effort to rebuild a modern version of the Horace Dobbins Cycleway, helped me locate his favorite photograph of this raised wooden cycleway and took me to the top of the Green Hotel so I could photograph the place where it once stood. John Harrigan, volunteer park ranger for the U.S. Forest Service, scouted one image of the Mt. Lowe Cable Car for us and, in mid-April, took Morgan Yates and me up to Granite Gate in the San Gabriel Mountains to take a large-format view of it. This spectacular trip was made more memorable by Harrigan's enthusiasm: he pointed out plants in bloom along the way - ceanothus or \"California lilac,\" wild hyacinth, rose, and wishbone bush - and characterized Mt. Lowe's railway as a tourist attraction made compelling not only by its miraculous engineering but also by the breathtaking views and dizzying heights \"that would still surpass any thrill-ride found at Disneyland.\" While exploring Pasadena with these knowledgeable, enthusiastic residents, who helped transport me back in time, I often reflected on how to best convey the experience of these encounters within the actual physical environment. It is my hope that the DVD-ROM with its \"bleed-throughs\" and commentaries will enable viewers to move between past and present and to navigate this space as a journey through time, and that this excerpt will inspire you to seek out the larger project._____________________________1 Bleeding Through was produced by the Labyrinth Project and ZKM (Center for Art and Media, Karlsruhe) in collaboration with writer and cultural historian Norman M.

Residents, preservationists, enthusiasts and schools, among others, will be invited to collect oral histories, photographs, home movies, and memorabilia for another exhibition and website. The following is a description of the production of  Cultivating Pasadena: From Roses to Redevelopment  Cultivating Pasadena stems from an earlier digital project, entitled Bleeding Through Layers of Los Angeles, 1920-1986, that simultaneously investigates the history of downtown Los Angeles and the nature of storytelling itself.1 While both projects involve rephotography, Cultivating Pasadena relies more heavily on this practice as a way of chronicling the evolving urban landscape. In the course of showing Bleeding Through to audiences, my co-creators and I noted that the digital cross-dissolves between vintage archival photographs and contemporary color views of the same urban scene elicited particular pleasure. This project is, in part, a response to that reaction and further inquiry into its cause.What is the source of this pleasure? Perhaps it is because in one visual moment we solve one mystery as another is uncovered. Now that we know what the site looked like from one point in time to another, are we then compelled to imagine how and why a site has changed so drastically or so little? What are the forces that transform a site from rural to urban, from well-tended and occupied to neglected and abandoned, from Victorian to modern? And what are the forces that keep something preserved? As one of the photographers on the Bleeding Through project, I began to think of rephotography as a form of time travel linking one point in time to another. It is also a form of time-lapse photography, demonstrating the passage of time while remaining in the same place, revealing cultural and physical changes that we may otherwise never see. More profoundly it demonstrates the existential nature of space and time - the disappearance of memory, the impermeability of things.Selecting the images to be rephotographed can be a challenging undertaking, particularly when trying to encapsulate the major characteristics of how a place developed over time. When I first browsed the on-line collection of the Automobile Club of Southern California looking for archival images of downtown Los Angeles for Bleeding Through, I was struck by how such mundane intentions, the documentation of road safety or traffic conditions, had often resulted in capturing something sublime. While a pristine Ansel Adams photograph of the moon over Half Dome demands that we view it in a particularly romantic way, the Automobile Club images had a refreshing unselfconsciousness. They provided a seemingly unadulterated look into the past that caught the unposed, the spontaneous, the inconsequential details that lend authenticity to a scene. In rephotographing Pasadena, we again returned to the collection of the Automobile Club (now our collaborators), looking for such representations of the city's past.This search proved more difficult than our team (Matt Roth and Morgan Yates of the Automobile Club and Marsha Kinder, Karen Voss and myself of the Annenberg Center) had first imagined. Now, rather than simply looking for something intangible that expressed the feel of the street, we needed a broad range of images that would chronicle Pasadena's unique development. While the Automobile Club's collection is stunning in its quality, its focus on transportation and planning necessitated that we explore additional archives - such as those belonging to USC, the Pasadena Museum of History, the Los Angeles Public Library, Caltech, and finally the California State Library - in order to represent other themes. As the prints were to be exhibited, we looked for archival photographs that contained fine detail and a wide tonal range. In some cases, however, this technical prerequisite was overridden by the desire to retain images that contained significant traces of the past - early prints so many generations removed from their original negative that they simultaneously preserve and erase the past. Although the selection process was methodical, a number of factors made it somewhat arbitrary - which archives we were able to access, how much time and money we had, the limitation on the number of prints to be exhibited and last but not least our personal aesthetic preferences. Thus the final selection of twenty-five pairs of photographs is far from exhaustive.The next step in our process involved a combination of detective work and location scouting, for the selection of images had to be narrowed to those sites we could re-find.2  We followed clues - the name of a residence, street names, a recognizable geological area, or urban landmark. Often, Lian Partlow, archivist from the Pasadena Museum of History, or some longtime resident, offered invaluable assistance in identifying a depicted site. Once we had a probable location, I then went there to take a series of digital shots that we would use to determine if it was indeed the correct location, and if it should be included as part of the exhibition prints. Some sites, I could not verify. Sometimes I sought out several photographs of the same site to help figure out, for example, whether a disappeared mansion sat facing Orange Grove Avenue or was set back from the road. I took many more photographs than would be included in the final twenty-five pairs, in part, because I was curious. Many of these additional images are included in the interactive DVD-ROM.Rephotography is an idiosyncratic way of getting to know a locale, a little like playing detective or archaeologist. What will be uncovered? A crime scene (in which something beautiful has been replaced by something hideous), an act of preservation, an improvement, or just a progression? Along with the challenge of simply finding the locations, these questions drove me out into Pasadena, day after day. Looking at so many images of Pasadena throughout its history was like trying to get acquainted with someone by paging through their family albums. After I had walked the streets and highways, entered buildings, climbed around the Arroyo, discovered the obvious panoramas, and met people from the Pasadena area, little by little, our selection grew and changed.Discovering more than 3,000 photographs by Frederick Martin in the California State Library collection, mostly depicting the San Gabriel Valley, also changed our selection. Well-composed, straightforward photographs taken between 1910 and 1930, they document much of Pasadena's landscape and architecture. Their sheer volume is compelling. Now not only did I speculate about Pasadena's past but also about Martin's reasons for thoroughly documenting so many of Pasadena's houses and gardens. According to Gary Kurutz, photography archivist in charge of this collection, little is known of Martin except that he settled in Pasadena at the turn of the century and began working for Kohler Photo Studio on Colorado Boulevard in 1902. He later took over the establishment, renaming it the Martin Studio. Martin died in 1949. Six of the photographs in the exhibition and book are by Martin, and many more of his images are found in the DVD-ROM. After the digital scouting, I began the analog photography using either a 4 x 5-inch large-format camera or a 6 x 9-cm medium-format camera. During these sessions, if the situation permitted, I tried to take my photograph at approximately the same time of day and from the same point of view as the original but using color film. (Rephotographing in color works well for cross-dissolves because it gives the viewer enough distinction between the archival and contemporary images to perceive where one begins and the other ends.) Street-widening and incredible tree growth made precision difficult in reconstructing some shots. At certain sites, little if anything of the original composition remained. For example, the Carr House and its surrounding Carmelita Park are now the location of the Norton Simon Museum. Although it was difficult to situate the Victorian homestead precisely, the transformation of a site created by one of Pasadena's early cultural patrons into a modern art museum suggests thematic continuity. In place of the once-massive Moorish-themed Universalist Church, a lone palm tree now stands, its trunk echoing the disappeared church tower. In rephotographing an early agricultural landscape taken from Monk Hill featuring the San Gabriel Mountains, I shot a wider view, letting the playground of Washington Middle School occupy more of the frame. In changing the framing I hoped to expand the notion of rephotography from an exact science for measuring physical changes to an interpretative tool for examining such cultural phenomena as land use and urban development. Showing what is beyond the periphery of the original view is one way to contextualize the images. That intention motivates Karen Voss's essay, Cultivating Pasadena, and is a primary aim of the interactive DVD-ROM. Designed to be a kind of \"vision machine,\" the DVD-ROM not only performs the cross-dissolves but also provides the viewer with other materials from our inquiry that might enrich the comparison between past and present. It includes the videotaped interviews of Pasadenans, quotes from experts and \"aficionados,\" as well as excerpts from period films and contemporary videos. From these multiple visual and intellectual perspectives on Pasadena's development, viewers can pursue their own investigations, driven by curiosity and chance.During my exploration of Pasadena, I encountered many knowledgeable people who were eager to help me uncover, in the contemporary landscape, the original views found in these archival photographs. Quite by accident I met Tim Brick of the Arroyo Seco Foundation, whose website I had been exploring (www.arroyoseco.org.) He was walking his dog along the Arroyo and wondered whether I was photographing an Oak tree that the city wanted to cut down. Some were protesting its destruction. Actually, I was trying to figure out the vantage point of a turn-of-the-century photograph of the Arroyo Seco before the Colorado Bridge was built. He joined me in searching for this view and told me where I could find other photographs of the Arroyo. In trying to locate one amazing Gothic-looking mansion dating from the turn-of-the-century, which I deduced had been located near the intersection of Pasadena and Arlington Avenues, I met a tenant in a house owned by Caltrans. She explained that Caltrans owned her unrestored home (a rarity in Pasadena) and all the others in that historic neighborhood due to a right-of-way battle to connect the 710 to the 210 Freeway. This battle had been going on for more than fifty years. On a subsequent visit, I met another woman who actually remembered the mansion, telling me precisely where it once stood and of its deterioration into an eerie run-down place that frightened the neighborhood children, including her. I went repeatedly to Washington Middle School, drawn by its fabulous location on Monk Hill. Teachers, custodians, administrators, and vice-principal, Robert Tanous, allowed me to use the windows and roofs of their buildings as lookout points from which to make photographs. There I stumbled upon one landscape view that I had been hunting for days: the setting for the original Washington School, built in 1884 and now gone. This school on Monk Hill came to symbolize for me the future of Pasadena, as a harmonious and ethnically diverse population nestled within a stunning landscape. While searching for the site of reputedly the first house built in Pasadena in February 1874, by early founding father Albert O. Bristol, I met Frank Burkard, Sr., of Burkard Nursery. We surmised that his nursery, on the southwest corner of Lincoln and Orange Grove, is located next to where the Bristol \"honeymoon cottage\" must have stood. Although Burkard did not recall the cottage (pictured in our book), he did remember the Victorian house that Bristol had built next door in 1888. The cottage burned down in 1936 (a year before Burkard's father opened the nursery) and the Victorian house, of which I could not find a photograph, was most likely torn down in the late 1960s. In its place is a commercial complex that includes, among other community services, the NAACP. There I met Janet Akosua Edge, a charter member of the branch in Altadena since 1984, who also grew up in this neighborhood. Her recollections begin around 1957 when this part of North Pasadena was a self-contained African-American enclave with its own caterers, churches, childcare, library, barbershops, mortuaries, parks, schools, and stores. The dismantling of this large, closely knit community coincided, she felt,  with the construction of the Jackie Robinson Center built in 1974 on the east and west sides of North Fair Oaks. Presented as a benefit to the community, she sensed it was really a diversionary tactic that allowed developers to maneuver long-time residents out of their bungalows, cottages and Victorians in preparation for further improvements that never materialized. She graciously agreed to be interviewed about this neighborhood for the Cultivating Pasadena project.Many residents were especially accommodating. Volunteer gardeners at the Lummis house trimmed away foliage from a tree so that a little more of this stone masterpiece could be captured. Two residents above Devil's Gate Dam allowed me to wander their property several times looking for just the right view. While scouting Bungalow Heaven, one interested owner on Claremont Street suggested the best of Martin's images to rephotograph was the bungalow with the children in front of it, two doors down. When I asked to photograph the famous Blacker House, its owners Dr. Ellen Knell and Mr. Harvey Knell, who are inundated with such requests, kindly agreed. We also sought out people. Dennis Crowley, a historian and bike enthusiast who is leading an effort to rebuild a modern version of the Horace Dobbins Cycleway, helped me locate his favorite photograph of this raised wooden cycleway and took me to the top of the Green Hotel so I could photograph the place where it once stood. John Harrigan, volunteer park ranger for the U.S. Forest Service, scouted one image of the Mt. Lowe Cable Car for us and, in mid-April, took Morgan Yates and me up to Granite Gate in the San Gabriel Mountains to take a large-format view of it. This spectacular trip was made more memorable by Harrigan's enthusiasm: he pointed out plants in bloom along the way - ceanothus or \"California lilac,\" wild hyacinth, rose, and wishbone bush - and characterized Mt. Lowe's railway as a tourist attraction made compelling not only by its miraculous engineering but also by the breathtaking views and dizzying heights \"that would still surpass any thrill-ride found at Disneyland.\" While exploring Pasadena with these knowledgeable, enthusiastic residents, who helped transport me back in time, I often reflected on how to best convey the experience of these encounters within the actual physical environment. It is my hope that the DVD-ROM with its \"bleed-throughs\" and commentaries will enable viewers to move between past and present and to navigate this space as a journey through time, and that this excerpt will inspire you to seek out the larger project._____________________________1 Bleeding Through was produced by the Labyrinth Project and ZKM (Center for Art and Media, Karlsruhe) in collaboration with writer and cultural historian Norman M.

Not in a plane but superman-like, zooming through space, arms stretched out to catch the air, or, more accurately, the abstracted pixels that comprise the god-view in the popular online world of Second Life.  Flying did not come naturally to me (I'm prone to motion sickness when images race by), but, with practice, I soon came to enjoy my time 'above' and began to hover in the sky with frequency.  Of course, my computer had begun to train me for such modes of viewing long before I dressed up my avatar and started collecting Linden dollars.  My desktop sports an aerial image of the roof of my house, courtesy of Zillow.  Rarely a week passes that I don't zoom in and out of a Google map, navigating scale with ease.  Various computer games have habituated me to an easy transit from micro to macro.  In short, I've grown accustomed to the god view and can easily inhabit its perspective.'Dead Reckoning\" seeks to demystify this aerial view, carefully revealing its mediated and constructed nature as well as its long history. As Caren Kaplan reminds us within the piece, the development of perspective during the European Renaissance re-ordered the visual field.  The piece not only tracks the techniques and technologies utilized to render perspective and vision, particularly as deployed by the military; it also insists that these modes of vision are never neutral, never simply \"discovered.\"  Indeed, the uses of perspective and of aerial vision track quite closely to the histories of empire and colonization, revealing telling feedback loops between modes of perception and the ascendancy of the nation state.  If visual studies has now attuned the scholar to the politics of vision, the particular brilliance of this piece is its experiential dimension.  Rather than fetishize the aerial view, the design of the project continually foregrounds the highly artificial nature of seeing from above, subtly interrupting a \"perfect\" view with blocks of scrolling, mobile text.  In some moments, multiple windows appear, blocking the view entirely, demanding that the user engage (or at least minimize) the analysis in order to create a \"better\" view.  The interface intentionally confounds the easy ability to see everything or to move easily between zones.  Rather than sustain the dream of perfect transparency that so fuels commercial interface design, \"Dead Reckoning\" subtly foregrounds the presence of the machine and the program.  Images in the piece are rarely pristine or clear, not by error but by design and with intention, leading us to question the relationship between what we (imagine we) see and what we (think we) know. As such, the project asks us to interrogate the very conditions of visibility that enable our experience of daily life, helping us to perceive the ideological stakes of perception itself.  As the user navigates through the piece, manipulating eyeballs, targets, tiny planes, and pixels, her perceptual capacity is re-skilled and refined, allowing her to better understand the technological camouflage that so intricately guides our contemporary ways of seeing.  Patience and engagement are rewarded, unfolding new layers of meaning and text, underscoring that there is more here than at first meets the eye. We are reminded that sight is never natural, that perspective is always political, and that the ability to zoom through landscapes or to designate borders is unevenly distributed, enabled by vast networks of power that we would do well to remember and question.— Vectors Journal Editorial Staff\\\\n\\n\\t\\n\\tDead Reckoning\\n\\tAerial Perception and the Social Construction of Targets\\n\\t\\nBy Caren Kaplan\\nDesign by Raegan KellyAuthor's Statement'Traditionally, the geographer, like the mythical Atlas chosen as a symbol by the Flemish cartographer Gérard Mercator, looks down on the earth from the top of a watchtower.

Aerial perspective and the rise of an imperial world view become intrinsic to the discursive representations of contemporary nation-states. \\tThis piece is book-ended, as it happens, by disasters wrought by human beings. I began to think about this piece of the book I am working on after the attacks on September 11, 2001 when I became preoccupied by the irony of the use of civilian airplanes and \"peacetime\" air space to wreck havoc and destruction. To many of us, air space is the epitome of \"free\" space. When did the air above the earth get divided into national, state, civil, and military portions and at what strata and markers do such borders begin and end? And how interesting that commercial airplanes-first, symbols of individual, entrepreneurial freedom and invention and, then, exemplars of popularized mass tourism and corporate might-delivered the \"bomb,\" as it were. I had been working on questions of cosmopolitan world views, discourses of location, and navigational technologies. At the juncture of 2001, I redirected the project to study the rise of \"air power,\" militarization of space, and the emergence of new kinds of targets and warfare. Thus, this Vectors project on Euro-American air power began with an inquiry into \"mobility\" and, in collaboration with Raegan Kelly, my Vectors' designer/programmer, it has morphed into a tutorial on technologies of sight in Western Euro-American modernity. Mobility remains a vital part of this piece since all vectors go somewhere. In this piece we have been working to figure out a few of those places and some of the effects of aerial perception in this age of US imperialism and global warfare. Hurricane Katrina, billed by the media (who seem to have short memories), as one of the worst disasters to affect the United States, occurred as I was finishing most of the work for this online piece. As we viewed the reproductions of images from Google Earth or any other commercial or non-military source of aerial visual data last year, we could well have wondered if targets are natural like the storms and surges that swept into people's lives or whether they (the targets and the devastating forces of destruction) are made by us, by our country, painstakingly, at great cost, only to be validated by the violence and made again. \\t\"Dead reckoning\" has a number of different meanings. For many of us, it simply means the ways in which we figure out where we are or what we are aiming at by using the naked eye-it is, then, the first order cultural construct of directional sight. In strictly navigational terms, especially at sea, it refers to the use of measured distances between points to discern longitude. A reckoning is also a form of retribution or punishment as well as a collection of accounts. Many of these meanings come into play in a militarized context where the determination of position enhanced by technology enables the annihilation of enemies. In this piece, Raegan and I came to see this term as the one best suited to describe what we were working through over many discussions. Although many other techniques of sight are involved in this piece, the reckoning of the cultural politics of sight in modernity leads, unfortunately, to state-sponsored death as much as to anything else and, thus, the aptness of the term becomes almost unavoidable.— Caren Kaplan\"Traditionally, the geographer, like the mythical Atlas chosen as a symbol by the Flemish cartographer Gérard Mercator, looks down on the earth from the top of a watchtower.

As with many digital bombsight images, the most recognizable object in this image is formed by the perpendicular intersecting lines in its center. Once one apprehends that figure, everything 'beyond' it is understood as being (or having been) target.According to www.mnf-iraq.com, the image above was recorded just after F-16 fighter jets dropped two 500-pound bombs on or near al-Zarqawi's concurrent location (a house). I spent some time looking at other images associated with this air strike. An oblique aerial shot of the aftermath helped me to perceive the repeating pattern in the bombsight image as comprised of the tops of palm trees, and the relatively dark bisecting diagonal line as a road. The soft edged, continuous tone area (read 'clouds') in the lower right quadrant is presumably the airborne post-detonation remains of hard (and soft) targets.The focus of my statement, however, will be the two images included in the article describing the circumstances of al-Zarqawi's death. They are the bombsight snapshot I include above, and another aerial shot, a portrait shot of the corpse of al-Zarqawi. (I captured a screenshot. The contents are upsetting, more so because they are so representative.)I was deep into early development of Dead Reckoning the first time I noticed such a juxtaposition in the New York Times online edition. An article on the U.S. bombing campaign in Baghdad presented an aerial bombsight image of a target zone alongside a portrait of a deceased male Iraqi photographed from an angle so oblique that the man's body filled the frame. Certainly the image of death, so breathtakingly close up, and so distressing, from my point of view, for myriad political and human reasons, was initially what riveted my attention.  After forcing myself to look at it awhile, though, I wondered at the jump cut it represented. Baghdad recon, dead Iraqi. Or, we shoot, the enemy dies...Wait, no, we LOOK, the enemy dies. (The caption was specific as to the man's identity as 'enemy'”'one of Saddam's guards.) I saw the same affirmation, or summation, of the promise of asymmetrical warfare and bio-technological dominance from the air many times during Israel's war on Lebanon last summer. This time, the bombsight photograph was generally but not always supplanted by its logical forebear, the map, or more specifically, the map with arrows on it, pinpointing targets of the daily bombing raids. (Further narrative compression: we PLAN, they die). The pairing I can't erase from my mind's eye is a simple map of Beirut with an arrow on it atop the same size portrait shot of a Lebanese child, again male, also dead. (The expression of ambivalence in relation to this war waged by that country is clear here”\"though the New York Times borrowed from themselves the same tropes they use to assert our technological supremacy (i.e., military success) in times of war and/or occupation, they seemed less convicted about Israel's cause (or, afraid of seeming too convicted about it, I don't know), and frequently exhibited images of dead Lebanese civilians).What is specifically relevant to the project of Dead Reckoning are some visual characteristics common to both types of extreme image making. Viewed in the aforementioned contexts”\"war reporting to the citizen consumer”\"both are employed as evidence meant to be conclusive. Both delimit their subjects mechanically, stripping each of context and specific content, using framing/proximity to reduce their subjects to abstraction.  Without the superimposition of what is presumably 'real-time' targeting information (rendered official by the censor's hand), the bombsight image could be an image of berber carpet. The death's head image, as colorful and 'detailed' as the bombsight abstraction is not, acts as a register of the most superficial of characteristics: gender, approximate age, possibly 'race', state of decay. Blood is always in evidence in these photographs (fresh kill), and functions again as inscription. Both are images taken from above, one presumably from a plane in the sky looking down, one standing over the body. Following this, neither contains a horizon. Following that, neither can easily be located in space or placed in physical context. Thus decontextualized, these images are ripe for recontextualization. (Cropping is key here - relatively speaking, the camera is located so that significant areas of the 'subject' fall out of frame or view.) Both are taken after the facts they attest to.Finally, there is a difference between the two images that has to do with agency. The bombsight image (and the map) reproduce what Caren calls a disembodied 'machinic  vision'. The corpse poses are embodied images, meaning, the recording mechanism's physical relationship to the subject retains human dimension. We instinctively infer the body of the photographer crouching or stooping over the body of the other. The bombsight image, parallel to and thousands of feet above the earth's surface, must be captured with the aid of machines. And we know these machines can be controlled remotely. So, not to oversimplify (though over-simplification is the name of the game), the heroic narrative opens with our machines making perfect war on imperfect bodies, and closes with our personnel-intact!!-gathering the evidence.The bombsight image and the corpse portrait are supposed to be read as images of prone subjects. Their juxtaposition works to establish a causal link from one to the other. (We assume the image of targeting produces the image of targeted). Our imagination, primed by exposure to film, television, Pentagon press conferences and other such images, joins the bomb, exits the bomber's belly, plummets through the atmosphere, crashes through palm trees, the roof, and into the room where al-Zarqawi is sitting, unaware. He dies. Mission accomplished. Having done our part, we meet the ultimate target (subject?) of this kind of visual manipulation: ourselves.— Raegan Kelly","citation_source_nom":"","citation_source_url":"","date":"2007","perspectives":"","mediums":"","materiaux":"","genres":"","pays":"","collections":"vectors-journal","organisations":"","video":"https://vimeo.com/180025973/8d0e91858b#t=3858s","images":["data/c2bf75dd-a4b6-4deb-9a5d-a8c025476142.png"],"preview":"","plateformes":"","tags":"histoire, géographie, texte, dessin, modélisation 3D","répertoires":"","technologies":"","description":"\\n\\t\\n\\tDead Reckoning\\n\\tAerial Perception and the Social Construction of Targets\\n\\t\\nBy Caren Kaplan\\nDesign by Raegan KellyEditor's IntroductionI recently learned to fly.

An article on the U.S. bombing campaign in Baghdad presented an aerial bombsight image of a target zone alongside a portrait of a deceased male Iraqi photographed from an angle so oblique that the man's body filled the frame. Certainly the image of death, so breathtakingly close up, and so distressing, from my point of view, for myriad political and human reasons, was initially what riveted my attention.  After forcing myself to look at it awhile, though, I wondered at the jump cut it represented. Baghdad recon, dead Iraqi. Or, we shoot, the enemy dies...Wait, no, we LOOK, the enemy dies. (The caption was specific as to the man's identity as 'enemy'”'one of Saddam's guards.) I saw the same affirmation, or summation, of the promise of asymmetrical warfare and bio-technological dominance from the air many times during Israel's war on Lebanon last summer. This time, the bombsight photograph was generally but not always supplanted by its logical forebear, the map, or more specifically, the map with arrows on it, pinpointing targets of the daily bombing raids. (Further narrative compression: we PLAN, they die). The pairing I can't erase from my mind's eye is a simple map of Beirut with an arrow on it atop the same size portrait shot of a Lebanese child, again male, also dead. (The expression of ambivalence in relation to this war waged by that country is clear here”\"though the New York Times borrowed from themselves the same tropes they use to assert our technological supremacy (i.e., military success) in times of war and/or occupation, they seemed less convicted about Israel's cause (or, afraid of seeming too convicted about it, I don't know), and frequently exhibited images of dead Lebanese civilians).What is specifically relevant to the project of Dead Reckoning are some visual characteristics common to both types of extreme image making. Viewed in the aforementioned contexts”\"war reporting to the citizen consumer”\"both are employed as evidence meant to be conclusive. Both delimit their subjects mechanically, stripping each of context and specific content, using framing/proximity to reduce their subjects to abstraction.  Without the superimposition of what is presumably 'real-time' targeting information (rendered official by the censor's hand), the bombsight image could be an image of berber carpet. The death's head image, as colorful and 'detailed' as the bombsight abstraction is not, acts as a register of the most superficial of characteristics: gender, approximate age, possibly 'race', state of decay. Blood is always in evidence in these photographs (fresh kill), and functions again as inscription. Both are images taken from above, one presumably from a plane in the sky looking down, one standing over the body. Following this, neither contains a horizon. Following that, neither can easily be located in space or placed in physical context. Thus decontextualized, these images are ripe for recontextualization. (Cropping is key here - relatively speaking, the camera is located so that significant areas of the 'subject' fall out of frame or view.) Both are taken after the facts they attest to.Finally, there is a difference between the two images that has to do with agency. The bombsight image (and the map) reproduce what Caren calls a disembodied 'machinic  vision'. The corpse poses are embodied images, meaning, the recording mechanism's physical relationship to the subject retains human dimension. We instinctively infer the body of the photographer crouching or stooping over the body of the other. The bombsight image, parallel to and thousands of feet above the earth's surface, must be captured with the aid of machines. And we know these machines can be controlled remotely. So, not to oversimplify (though over-simplification is the name of the game), the heroic narrative opens with our machines making perfect war on imperfect bodies, and closes with our personnel-intact!!-gathering the evidence.The bombsight image and the corpse portrait are supposed to be read as images of prone subjects. Their juxtaposition works to establish a causal link from one to the other. (We assume the image of targeting produces the image of targeted). Our imagination, primed by exposure to film, television, Pentagon press conferences and other such images, joins the bomb, exits the bomber's belly, plummets through the atmosphere, crashes through palm trees, the roof, and into the room where al-Zarqawi is sitting, unaware. He dies. Mission accomplished. Having done our part, we meet the ultimate target (subject?) of this kind of visual manipulation: ourselves.— Raegan Kelly","collection":"pièces"},{"id":"deliberative-democracy-and-difference","url":"http://vectorsjournal.org/projects/index.php?project=81","titre":"Deliberative Democracy and Difference","personnes":"Mark Kann","citation":"\\n\\t\\n\\tDeliberative Democracy and Difference\\n\\t\\nBy Mark Kann\\nDesign by Alessandro CegliaEditor's IntroductionIn the heady dot.com days around about 1997, many commentators celebrated the web's potential to foster a vibrant electronic public sphere.

Alex was fascinated with the predispositions that participants bring to deliberative forums.  These predispositions--including  flexibility, assertiveness, and persuasiveness--seem to be likely \"non-rational\" influences on the outcomes of deliberations.

Drawing on materials collected in more than a decade of field work, Christen and her collaborators have created a complex, multimedia artifact that moves far beyond Discovery Channel-type explorations of cultural difference.  Instead, the project models the unique systems of belief and of shared ownership that underpin Warumungu knowledge production and reproduction, including a system of \"protocols\" that limit access to information or to images in accordance with Aboriginal systems of accountability.     The site is experiential, but it does not presume cultural experience to be something we should take for granted as a birth right of the digital age.  Digital Dynamics Across Cultures does not invite the (Western) viewer to \"become Aboriginal\" or to assume another's identity, that avatar-based standard of so many products of digital culture.  Rather, the experiences it constructs are partial, embedded, and provisional, barring access to specific images or performances, in a manner consistent with the logics or protocols of the Warumungu people.  As such, the site stages a series of complex negotiations that trouble easy binary assumptions about the nature of intellectual property, the boundaries between the public and private, and the relationship of self to both place and history.  Digital Dynamics Across Cultures denies the tourist's gaze, refusing to fix the Warumungu as objects for our consumption, either embalmed in a distant past or locked in an electronic present.  The algorithmically-driven database structure of the project means that only a small slice of its vast contents is available during any one visit.  The materials available for exploration shift and mutate with each click of the refresh button, highlighting the ephemeral nature of digital forms and of any sense that we might systematically be able to know \"the Other.\"  The project also demands an ongoing process of collaboration and dialogue between Christen and the Warumungu, as the protocols it models require that the database be consistently updated to reflect changes in the community.  Such a process underscores that the mutability of digital forms reaches far beyond the database to the lived worlds we all inhabit.— Vectors Journal Editorial Staff\\\\n\\n\\t\\n\\tDigital Dynamics Across Cultures\\n\\t\\nBy Kim Christen & Chris Cooney\\nDesign by Alessandro CegliaAuthor's StatementThis project grows out of my collaborations with Warumungu people in Tennant Creek, N.T. Australia over the last ten years.  During this time, I worked with rotating groups of Warumungu men and women on a range of projects—all of which involved taking photographs and digital video recordings.  Although the projects culminated in various 'products,\" in every case, we were guided by a set of cultural protocols concerning the circulation, creation and reproduction of Warumungu knowledge and traditions.  This meant, for instance, that some ritual songs we recorded could only be heard by women, or that some photographs could only be viewed by particular family groups, or that particular video footage of ancestral sites could not be viewed by the uninitiated.  At the most basic level this system operated within the logic of an \"open\"/\"closed\" binary.  Some information is open, anyone has access. Other material is closed, only those with the proper knowledge have access.  Yet the binary does not hold.  Instead, there is a continuum between open and closed.  Within this continuum various factors determine levels of access, gradations of control and multiple levels of engagement.  These factors include (but are not limited to): gender, age, kin relations, country affiliations, and ritual knowledge. This is a dynamic system, then, that allows for the continual remaking and repackaging of Warumungu knowledge and tradition within various networks.  And because Warumungu social networks include land (\"country\"), other-than-human relatives (\"ancestors\"), local kin groups (\"mobs\") as well as outsiders, the maintenance and creation of \"proper\"—but not static—traditional knowledge and cultural products involves constant negotiation. (For my article that develops this further see: Gone Digital)Warumungu cultural protocols concerning authorship, ownership, viewing practices and knowledge creation are an intellectual property rights (IPR) system—a set of standards and limits for the use, redistribution, and reproduction of knowledge in its intangible (and tangible) forms. But the links between these Warumungu digital dynamics and the national and international legal systems in which they circulate are not stable.  Legal regimes that demand a rigid public/private split and an author-centered notion of production deny Warumungu notions of property, access and circulation that are based neither on individual nor communal ownership.  Instead, Warumungu groups base their distributional imaginary within dynamic relationships between small groups of people, related countries and ancestral relations.This Vectors' site is designed to make Warumungu cultural protocols for the distribution, reproduction and creation of knowledge the primary logic.  This is not a learning site—in the sense that users will come away knowing about \"the Warumungu\" in any complete sense. In the design concept we wanted to stay away from what I clumsily labeled a \"video-game\" feel.  That is, we did not want to give users the \"experience\" of being (via an avatar-like persona) an Aboriginal person for a day.  Nor did we want people to feel as if they could learn about Warumungu culture \"whole cloth\" through this site.  This was not because of some lurking Luddite sensibilities or a knee-jerk Humanities reaction to \"dumbing-down\" the complexity of cross-cultural exchange.  Instead, the site is deigned to alter the way in which \"learning\" about other cultures is perceived and presented. By presenting \"content\" through a set of Warumungu cultural protocols that both limit and enhance (depending on who you are) the exchange, distribution and creation of knowledge, the site's internal logic challenges conventional Western notions of the \"freedom\" of information and knowledge \"sharing\" as well as legal demands for single-authored, \"innovative,\" original works as the benchmark for intellectual property definitions. As users navigate through the site, they will encounter the protocols that limit, define and account for a dynamic and multiply-produced understanding of knowledge distribution and reproduction.— Kim Christen\\\\n\\n\\t\\n\\tDigital Dynamics Across Cultures\\n\\t\\nBy Kim Christen & Chris Cooney\\nDesign by Alessandro CegliaDesigner's StatementWhen I first spoke to Professor Kim Christen and Chris Cooney about the design for Digital Dynamics Across Cultures, I was immediately struck by the challenge (and the apparent paradox) of building an interactive piece that centered around information that could not be freely shared.  Kim had amassed this vast library of images, videos, and recordings of Warumungu society, precisely the kind of content that one would normally want to display, but that, in the context of this project and Warumungu culture, could not be openly viewed.  If we were going to make our point, it couldn't be through what we showed.  It would have to be through what we didn't show or what we chose to conceal.THE BACKENDThe first step was to store and organize all of Kim's content in a database.  A database would give us flexible control.  Craig Dietrich and I set up a system whereby Kim and Chris can easily update, modify, add or remove content, and, most importantly given the cultural protocols they are dealing with, control whether or not a particular image, video, or other element appears online.Because of the sheer quantity of content, Craig and I then set about creating an algorithm that sifts through the database and pulls a representational assortment of content which I then use to populate the Digital Dynamics Across Cultures site (the frontend) -- enough content for Kim to make her point but not too much so as to overwhelm the user.  This algorithm also ensures that each visit to the site is unique: each visit uses a different assortment of content to make the same argument.THE FRONTENDI should begin by saying that the site itself, what you see when you access the project, is completely dynamic in all aspects: from the number of places that appear on the map, to the images and text displayed on the page, they are all determined by and will vary based on what Kim and Chris upload to the database.So how should the user experience all of this content?  Since place is a defining element in Warumungu society, I chose an abstract painting of a map of the Warumungu community as my initial source of inspiration for the primary navigation system.  Kim, Chris and I all agreed, however, that we shouldn't get overly literal in our implementation of a map, so the interface was never intended to function as a 'real\" map.  The relative position of each place remains constant to give the interface a sort of geographical grounding, but the map the interface represents is not to scale and the geographical relationship between each place is only roughly approximated.  Moreover, much like the content that populates the site, the absolute position of each place varies with each visit.  In effect, the places aren't really physical places at all -- more like digital repositories of cultural information (some of which is inaccessible) hovering around a digital focal point... much like the site itself, floating somewhere out there in cyberspace.The secondary interface, that kind of single-celled organism that splits and divides when interacted with, was also inspired by Warumungu paintings, but, for me, also captures the spirit of exploration that the site demands from the user.  Dig around a little, and see what pops up.  Learn about the protocols through direct experience, as you travel through this virtual landscape and interact with its inhabitants, and not only by reading about them in a book.The protocol elements that appear throughout the site (the pop-up windows, the tape mask) and that are ultimately the central focus of the project are meant to be jarring and slightly disruptive.  We want the user to come across a few road blocks as he or she explores the site, and to have that experience be educational, a kind of negative reinforcement, if you will.— Alessandro Ceglia","citation_source_nom":"","citation_source_url":"","date":"2006","perspectives":"","mediums":"","materiaux":"","genres":"","pays":"","collections":"vectors-journal","organisations":"","video":"https://vimeo.com/180025973/8d0e91858b#t=2755s","images":["data/2beb3b7b-edab-42cd-8f87-435361a68ad6.png"],"preview":"","plateformes":"","tags":"anthropologie, texte, graphe, photographie, dessin, audio, vidéo","répertoires":"","technologies":"","description":"\\n\\t\\n\\tDigital Dynamics Across Cultures\\n\\t\\nBy Kim Christen & Chris Cooney\\nDesign by Alessandro CegliaEditor's IntroductionDigital Dynamics Across Cultures re-imagines the work of anthropology in the age of digital reproduction, and, by extension, explores the cross-cultural implications of several seeming truisms of the electronic era.

Kim had amassed this vast library of images, videos, and recordings of Warumungu society, precisely the kind of content that one would normally want to display, but that, in the context of this project and Warumungu culture, could not be openly viewed.  If we were going to make our point, it couldn't be through what we showed.  It would have to be through what we didn't show or what we chose to conceal.THE BACKENDThe first step was to store and organize all of Kim's content in a database.  A database would give us flexible control.  Craig Dietrich and I set up a system whereby Kim and Chris can easily update, modify, add or remove content, and, most importantly given the cultural protocols they are dealing with, control whether or not a particular image, video, or other element appears online.Because of the sheer quantity of content, Craig and I then set about creating an algorithm that sifts through the database and pulls a representational assortment of content which I then use to populate the Digital Dynamics Across Cultures site (the frontend) -- enough content for Kim to make her point but not too much so as to overwhelm the user.  This algorithm also ensures that each visit to the site is unique: each visit uses a different assortment of content to make the same argument.THE FRONTENDI should begin by saying that the site itself, what you see when you access the project, is completely dynamic in all aspects: from the number of places that appear on the map, to the images and text displayed on the page, they are all determined by and will vary based on what Kim and Chris upload to the database.So how should the user experience all of this content?  Since place is a defining element in Warumungu society, I chose an abstract painting of a map of the Warumungu community as my initial source of inspiration for the primary navigation system.  Kim, Chris and I all agreed, however, that we shouldn't get overly literal in our implementation of a map, so the interface was never intended to function as a 'real\" map.  The relative position of each place remains constant to give the interface a sort of geographical grounding, but the map the interface represents is not to scale and the geographical relationship between each place is only roughly approximated.  Moreover, much like the content that populates the site, the absolute position of each place varies with each visit.  In effect, the places aren't really physical places at all -- more like digital repositories of cultural information (some of which is inaccessible) hovering around a digital focal point... much like the site itself, floating somewhere out there in cyberspace.The secondary interface, that kind of single-celled organism that splits and divides when interacted with, was also inspired by Warumungu paintings, but, for me, also captures the spirit of exploration that the site demands from the user.  Dig around a little, and see what pops up.  Learn about the protocols through direct experience, as you travel through this virtual landscape and interact with its inhabitants, and not only by reading about them in a book.The protocol elements that appear throughout the site (the pop-up windows, the tape mask) and that are ultimately the central focus of the project are meant to be jarring and slightly disruptive.  We want the user to come across a few road blocks as he or she explores the site, and to have that experience be educational, a kind of negative reinforcement, if you will.— Alessandro Ceglia","collection":"pièces"},{"id":"digital-futures","url":"http://vectorsjournal.org/projects/index.php?project=90","titre":"Digital Futures","personnes":"Elizabeth Povinelli","citation":"We discussed the idea of using computer code to illustrate the gates of access that other post-colonial digital archives have used to try to replicate social structures of the cultures they represent- Peter Cho, Designer's Statement\\n\\nEditor's IntroductionWhat does it mean to say that knowledge wants to be free?

As mass digitization projects continue to unfold along both commercial and public registers, these are not simply rhetorical questions.  As scholars working with and through the critical legacies of Foucault and Derrida, we know all too well that the archive is a site of power and a locus of the state.  Digitizing the archive and opening it up to broad access does not dispel these positivist functions.

The project began as a conversation with Ruby about how to transfer the archive, that I had accumulated over the last twenty-four years, to her family who lived at Belyuen, a small indigenous community in northwestern Australia. The project is inspired by recent attempts to embed alternative modes of social life in the operating systems of digital archives. These efforts operate in the shadow of Foucault and Derrida's critical engagement with the western state archive. They understand, as Ann Stoler noted, that archives are not sites of knowledge retrieval but of knowledge production; or, in the act of retrieving information from archives the users of archives reproduce and conserve state power.  Much of the focus of this work has focused on how to encode alternative modes of circulation, access, and control of information into digital archives. Taking such critiques on board consciously or not, the authors of these digital archives assume—and foreground as part of the interaction protocol of the site—that the production and circulation of knowledge consolidates power—that power has a formation—is en-formed. And so they attempt to foreground and encode as protocols the competing organizations of knowledge and power in the very operation of system of knowledge circulation and access.  This project also foregrounds the issue of power. But it asks what a postcolonial digital archive becomes if, instead of information, circulation, and access, we interrogate it from the perspective of socialities of obligation, responsibility and attachment. What is not asked when we consider the archive from the perspective of knowledge production, circulation, and access? How are these problems imposed by the vary ways that code and software depend of stranger sociality whether that stranger is considered an individual or a set of cultural rules and protocols? Is it necessary to agree to this stranger sociality in order to play digitally? And if so, what forms of sociality are being extended even as we are allowed to provide different cultural rules and protocols?

We played with Google maps together and talked about the trope of 'zooming in'—what it might mean to 'get closer to a place' through a digital interface. We discussed the idea of using computer code to illustrate the gates of access that other post-colonial digital archives have used to try to replicate social structures of the cultures they represent.

Some ideas, such as including interactive genealogies or requiring the user to fill out surveys about their own economic and social status on entry, fell to the wayside as the project became a more focused narrative piece. This meant that Beth could focus on building her argument through the multi-layered video pieces that appear at each site, almost as a painter works: a few brush strokes here and there, gradually filling in the canvas to create an overall image.

In particular, cultural studies has asked us to attend to the power of representation as a locus for the formation of subjectivity and identity.  This work has produced important insights, but one wonders if such modes of analysis are sufficient to the networked age of electronic information.  Can an analysis of representation tell us much about the bitstream?Pushing past the surface of the screen, beyond the image, and, indeed, beyond the material world that surrounds us, Laura Marks challenges us to imagine an aesthetics that no longer need fixate on representation.  Rather, she insists on an aesthetics better suited to the digital era, an aesthetics of information that expands beyond the contours of the perceptible world toward the realms of information that so underpin almost all of contemporary experience.  Drawing on Charles Sanders Peirce's triadic epistemology, she offers us a tripartite mode of analysis in which experience, information and image function as planes of immanence, a conceptual framework that helps us to understand the dynamic, mutable relationship between these interlocking dimensions.  Experience is the most expansive of these planes, as all information and all images unfold from (and are, in turn, enfolded in) experience. As Marks observes, 'Experience is a vast archive whose contents are almost entirely enfolded.\"Marks' goal in creating an aesthetics of enfolding and unfolding is to analyze more precisely the ways in which artworks and other objects facilitate (or perhaps inhibit) the movement between experience, information, and image.  In effect, she is crafting a dynamic aesthetic model that begs for an equally dynamic implementation; her very writing pulsates and vibrates, folding in upon itself in an effort to capture the constant mobility she seeks to theorize.  Enter designer Raegan Kelly.  In this piece, Kelly's elegant animations help distill and enact the abstract contours of Marks' theory, percolating them into a new realm of experience without reducing their complexity.  At one level, the piece functions as a translation of Marks' writing into a time-based, animated process, perhaps integrating \"form\" and \"content\" to a lesser degree than many Vectors' projects.

In the collision of text and animation (and in the gray boxes that illustrate the lines of communication between Marks and Kelly during the construction of the piece), we come to see the process of enfolding-unfolding in its dynamism.It is important to observe that, in sketching this analytical model, Marks does not divorce the aesthetic from the political.  In fact, she locates her project within a materialist framework that recognizes that \"power lies in the ability to make things unfold, circulate, and enfold.\"  As she illustrates, such an analysis begins to explain the function of surveillance or the circulation of capital in an electronic era, elements of experience that impact us all yet typically escape our theories of representation.

Lunenfeld has a long history with experiments in electronic publication including the Mediawork pamphlet series for MIT Press and collaborations with designers including Mieke Gerritzen and Anne Burdick, resulting in scholarly works that are part art-object, part personal essay, and part showcase for his own eclectic interests. The consistent brilliance of Lunenfeld's work is its expansive scope and willingness to take risks to connect seemingly unrelated dots. Gidget on the Couch is no exception. The resulting video, created in collaboration with designer Dmitri Siegel, takes the specific affordances of its form - that of the video essay - seriously, including elements that are literally only possible on video, such as watching the author move through a variety of non-traditional on-screen academic personae: detective, surfer, fan. Lunenfeld travels the city in search of existing historical threads by which to tie together the loose ends of his story, mapping traces of the Austro-Hungarian empire from the Hollywood Hills to the beaches of Malibu. The graphics that subtend Lunenfeld's vehicular traversals are marked not by the geographic specificity of Southern California, but by conceptual touchpoints within his remapped history, reminiscent of the Situationist practice of navigating one urban environment using the map of another. Like all good contrarians, Lunenfeld sets out to challenge the received wisdom surrounding his object of study and, by proposing an outlandish inversion - say, that Southern California surfing culture derives from early 20th century Europe rather than the island cultures of Polynesia - invites viewers to think differently about the forms and conventions of scholarly practice. Like the Situationists, Lunenfeld aspires not necessarily to achieve the literal truth of the past but to expose the systems underlying the pathogenesis of historical narratives writ large.— Steve Anderson, October 5th, 2011        \\n\\\\nGidget, the book that started it all, has been back in print or more than a decade, Kathy, the one and only original Gidget, has been profiled in other documentaries, and is a guest of honor at surf festivals all over the country.- Peter Lunenfeld, Author's Statement\\n\\nAuthor's Statementwhy not come to the source????? you need not be shy....!!!!!'truth is better than copy\"(Email dated July 6, 2008 from Kathy Kohner Zuckerman, the \"real\" Gidget)How do ideas find form? What shape do they take when new modes of communication make innovative things possible? How do ideas survive when these same new technologies destroy the complex systems of production and distribution they depend on for nurture and sustenance? In an era of ubiquitous, infinite social distraction, how can we ensure that long form arguments endure?This last question is for me vastly more important than whether books survive electronic publishing or if libraries can afford to subscribe to journals, or any of the other assorted and endless crisis talk of the academy. This is because it is the long form argument that sustains intellectual culture, allowing philosophers the space to structure complex logics, historians to weave years of archival research into rich narrative tapestries, and sociologists to drill both deeply and widely into communities and their contexts. Contemporary communication environments are superb at certain forms of texuality: the header, the graph, and the tweet. But all-too-social media can confuse us into mistaking background noise for content, and debilitate rather than strengthen the disciplines required to focus concentration, energy, and resources on the long form argument.But didn't the high-tech marketers tell us that text itself would disappear, encasing itself in a silicon chrysalis and then emerge into this, our 21st century as an interactive, audio-visual butterfly? Well, again, we're pretty good at downloading and reposting captioned photographs, pop songs, and video snippets, but the multimediated, innovative scholarship we were waiting for has been little seen, and less downloaded. That is why I was so happy when a Vectors Fellowship allowed me to assemble a team to build a better butterfly. When you press the \"play\" button, you'll see a melding of text, image and sound that our team crafted into something of a long form argument, a new mode of knowledge formation.This project began with a sense that after two decades devoted to media philosophy and the exploration of new and often virtual technologies, it was time to write about my real, physical surroundings, more specifically the cultural history of Los Angeles. \"Gidget on the Couch: Freud, Dora (No Not That Dora), and the Secret Austro-Hungarian Roots of Surfing\" was the first of my forays into this new territory, and I was lucky enough to find a home for it in The Believer. Edited by novelists Heidi Julavits, Vendela Vida, and Ed Park, The Believer is not an academic journal, but it could play one on TV, dedicated as it is to reviews and essays that \"might hope to serve the culture,\" and famously opposed to the literary genre of \"snark.\"\"Gidget on the Couch\" uses the emergence of surfing in particular its transition from activity to lifestyle commodity as a way to think through the evolution of modernist architecture in Southern California, linking the nihilistic soul surfer Miki Dora to expatriate architect Rudolph Schindler via the \"real\" Gidget's family (which included one of Hollywood's first trans-media talent agents). In the way of many contemporary texts, the essay itself has been remediated in different ways already. You can read it in the June, 2008 issue, of course (which you can order here), or you can browse it on the magazine's site, or you can find it in the print collection, Read Hard: Five Years of Great Writing from The Believer (San Francisco: McSweeny's, 2009) available here, and you can even (re-?)read it in a reposting from the book at The Rumpus. So, that brings us to the version for Vectors, this most mediated of remediations, one in which the text is not illustrated so much as transmuted into a \"media script.\" I don't see an interchangeability between the visual and language, but rather a complementarity. The question is how to use each to best effect meaning. The visual can free the imagination and create fluid connections, but it is not an \"advance\" over the capacities of text, it is a different mode of knowledge production. The best filmmakers and designers understand how to harness the powers of each of the specific forms they use in transmedia projects, creating compelling synergies rather than frantic muddles. The act of thinking and then making a record of that process can be seen as a multi-valent, open position, as opposed to the older notion of \"writing\" or \"picture making.\" If texts in their broadest sense can be thought of as \"media scripts,\" then the specific medium that instantiates that script can change, evolve, morph, and even turn back upon itself depending upon the situation. But to get to this kind of \"visual intellectuality\" takes new kinds of training, new ways of working, and, quite often, new partners.I had known Dmitri Siegel's work for some time, as a multi-threat in the design world. With a background in art and an MFA in design from Yale, Dmitri has a reputation an innovative maker with gifts in typography, motion, and online media, who had been a guest lecturer in my department. A gifted critic, two of his essays in particular stand out as refined thinking on the profession of design in an era of D.I.Y. triumphant, \"Bartleby\" (12.11.05) and \"Designing Our Own Graves\" (06.27.06). He had done compelling motion typography for the Sundance Channel and the documentary Dr. Bronner's Magic Soapbox (d. Sara Lamm, 2006 - excerpts here). So, I was delighted when he expressed interest in working with me for the Vectors version of \"Gidget on the Couch.\" He knew he wanted to incorporate live action, and brought in Matthew Nourse, a filmmaker who had recently released his debut feature The Pacific and Eddy (2007) to direct. Dmitri was in Philadelphia, Matt and I in Los Angeles, so we spent a lot of time in Skype conversations and email roundelays. Dmitri came out at key points, and he, Matt, camera man Quetzal Aguilar, and the occasional sound person would drive through the city to translate \"Gidget on the Couch\" into a new medium. In the credits, Dmitri is listed as the producer, Matt as the director, and I'm the writer, but the nature of this sort of collaborative practice means that we were all sharing ideas and strategies. I sincerely hope that the product of the process is as fun to watch as it was to make.Transmediation is too often thought of as \"advancing\" through historical formats - stories get written down, hand-made manuscripts get printed, theatrical productions are filmed, movies become interactive - and thus does culture march on. But such tidy progress is neither a given (as the utter financial and aesthetic failure of the interactive cinema should remind us) nor even a good. Vectors' openness to multiple formats meant that we were free to follow any number of paths, a freedom that any good designer can tell you comes with its own shackles. After reading the essay a few times, Dmitri essentially said that he liked it as it was: a linear, if looping, narrative argument. We made the decision not to go the expected route for multimediation, which would have been to turn it into an interactive interface. Dmitri instead pushed for a video travelogue, with a loose, conversational tone for the voice-over, a sense of language that is equal parts seminar table discourse and lively bar chat. It was the transformation from the carefully worked prose of the article back into conversation that achieved, at least in my estimation, real transmediation rather than simply shoveling content from one medium to another. The maps and type treatment are Dmitri's as is the overarching concept for the piece. Matt's deft camera work and direction was integral to all of this, and reminds me of the wonderful interplay that Los Angeles makes possible given the immense skills the \"Industry\" attracts to this city.Other people and institutions contributed to the project as well. My MFA students were pressed into service to sit and listen to me talk through the project to offer visible proof of my professing. I appreciated the Mak Center LA's willingness to let us film at the Schindler House and to MAK Governing Committee Member Robert L. Sweeney for sharing his decades of commitment to and understanding of the Schindlers and the Kings Road House. Great thanks to David Rensin whose All for a Few Perfect Waves: The Audacious Life and Legend of Rebel Surfer Miki Dora (2008) stands as a great piece of journalism in the history not just of surf writing, but also the chronicling of Southern California.Over two decades in Los Angeles, my cross-town colleagues at USC have been a wonderful resource. I was delighted when Vectors offered me a fellowship to develop this project. The journal, under Tara McPherson and Steve Anderson has been at the forefront of so many of the issues that I care about - multimedia scholarship, the design of visual argument, the future of print and post-print scholarship, the mediation of digital humanities - that it felt like being away at home during the period of the fellowship and during the gestation of the project.Okay, I've done the theory, talked about the details of the practice, and thanked those who contributed. Now I'm at the end, and can feign nonchalance about having met and spent time with Kathy Kohner Zuckerman  the actual, real Gidget. A month after the essay first came out, I got three quick emails out of the blue from Kathy correcting some facts, and telling me to \"come to the source,\" since she lived a half an hour from me. Gidget, the book that started it all, has been back in print for more than a decade, Kathy, the one and only original Gidget, has been profiled in other documentaries, and is a guest of honor at surf festivals all over the country. We were lucky to have Kathy contribute her memories, insight and charisma to this project. It was an unmitigated pleasure to discuss long form ideas with an original long board surfer. Thanks, Gidge!— Peter Lunenfeld, September 21st, 2011        \\n\\\\nGidget, the book that started it all, has been back in print or more than a decade, Kathy, the one and only original Gidget, has been profiled in other documentaries, and is a guest of honor at surf festivals all over the country.- Peter Lunenfeld, Author's Statement\\n\\nDesigner's StatementFinding the form for Gidget on the Couch was tricky. In reading the original essay, I was taken by Peter's transitions between different ideas. It was the strength of the transitions that to me created a cohesive statement in the same way that an invisible image, projected from the mind, connects a group of stars into a constellation. I wanted to transpose or even transcode those segues, creating a piece that could crossfade between surfing and modernism, Malibu and Vienna.The transitions in the essay are deft but they are also very specific, even idiosyncratic - they are part of the overall voice of the writing. That led me to think that a first person approach was the way to go. The cadence of Peter's voice also attracted me and I wanted stay true to that. This pushed the project towards film/video as the medium rather than something more interactive.Some of my favorite sequences in the video are the maps which combine actual cartography with psychogeography. We were inspired by Peter's collection of Dell Mapbacks, cheap paperback mysteries from the 1940s that map out the locations and sometimes even the timing of the crimes. In our case, Sunset Boulevard is not only the street that links Schindler in West Hollywood to Peter at UCLA to Gidget and her father in Brentwood to Dora in Malibu, it is also the conceptual spine for the transitions between the constellations of ideas. Places mix with concepts, and the device of having Peter drive to the beach was partly determined by our desire to do a drive-by history of LA modernism. The route forms a through-line that becomes the motion carto-graphic. The drive is a Post-Situationist derive with the top down through Los Angeles, and the map makes explicit the connections that are laden in the original text.I should mention the director here, Matt Nourse, and our cameraman and jack-of-all-trades, Quetzel Aguilar. All of us work primarily in commercial contexts, and it was really fun to stretch with this content in the context of a Vectors piece. Matt in particular was attracted to creating a critically-driven rather than narratively-driven video. Matt, Quetzal and I also functioned as a mini-focus group for the language and approach Peter adopted. It was a form of democratic cultural production. A critical text translated through the lens of a team of makers, recrafting Peter's written style into spoken voice, making critical theory more accessible without dumbing it down.I wasn't looking to resolve this piece as neatly as short form documentaries tend to. The last thing we wanted was to make was a 'Behind the Music\" mini-drama. If we had a model, it was Reyner Banham Loves Los Angeles, which the great British architecture critic made for the BBC in 1972. It's kind of shaggy, but that's what's great about it. There's a heroic but knowing view of the critic: Banham's not a talking head behind a desk or a disembodied voice, he's out driving around LA, and loving every minute of it. In the end, we wanted to make an action movie about a scholar thinking and talking. We were excited to see the critic in action and Peter was willing to do his own stunts.— Dmitri Siegel, September 21st, 2011        \\n","citation_source_nom":"","citation_source_url":"","date":"2012","perspectives":"","mediums":"","materiaux":"","genres":"","pays":"","collections":"vectors-journal","organisations":"","video":"https://vimeo.com/180025973/8d0e91858b#t=7762s","images":["data/7294136b-6bb8-4fb7-a12f-d0b0d269718f.png"],"preview":"","plateformes":"","tags":"architecture, métrage vidéo","répertoires":"","technologies":"","description":"The best filmmakers and designers understand how to harness the powers of each of the specific forms they use in transmedia projects, creating compelling synergies rather than frantic muddles.- Peter Lunenfeld, Author's Statement\\n\\nEditor's IntroductionWe knew when we commissioned Peter Lunenfeld to create a project based on his article from The Believer 'Gidget on the Couch: Freud, Dora (No Not That Dora), and the Secret Austro-Hungarian Roots of Surfing\" that the result was likely to stretch the envelope of previous Vectors scholarship. Lunenfeld has a long history with experiments in electronic publication including the Mediawork pamphlet series for MIT Press and collaborations with designers including Mieke Gerritzen and Anne Burdick, resulting in scholarly works that are part art-object, part personal essay, and part showcase for his own eclectic interests. The consistent brilliance of Lunenfeld's work is its expansive scope and willingness to take risks to connect seemingly unrelated dots. Gidget on the Couch is no exception. The resulting video, created in collaboration with designer Dmitri Siegel, takes the specific affordances of its form - that of the video essay - seriously, including elements that are literally only possible on video, such as watching the author move through a variety of non-traditional on-screen academic personae: detective, surfer, fan. Lunenfeld travels the city in search of existing historical threads by which to tie together the loose ends of his story, mapping traces of the Austro-Hungarian empire from the Hollywood Hills to the beaches of Malibu.

To enter this archive is to enter a rarified space, a quiet zone accessed only with a special ID card and a trip through a metal detector.  No pens are allowed and no paper.  The histories collected here are special and guarded.  They unfold for the scholar and the expert, for those with credentials.  But what if we thought about the archive differently, as a place of open access and limited gatekeeping?  Digital technologies can help animate the archive in meaningful ways, pointing toward new modes of memory and history that engage the spirit of open access and democratic exchange while also undertaking very crucial work in cultural preservation.  The Hurricane Digital Memory Bank (HDMB) provides a vibrant model of just such an endeavor, functioning as a re-imagined archive, one conceived for the present and the future.     Over 500 images, numerous stories, and diverse other files -- including podcasts, PDFs, and more -- chronicle the powerful storms that ravaged the Gulf Coast region in fall 2005 and document the experiences of those affected by the worst hurricane season in recorded history.  As the user traverses the words and pictures gathered here, the human and material costs of the hurricanes come into more powerful relief, adding a new level of granularity, intimacy, and poignancy to mainstream media accounts.  We know that Hurricane Katrina unleashed the largest displacement in U.S. history; HDMB layers that knowledge with detailed meanings and diverse voices.  In my introduction to the second issue of Vectors, I commented on the limits of putting too much faith in technology when faced with a disaster like Katrina.  HDMB suggests that technology can also help us connect, remember, and perhaps heal.      The website reconfigures the goals of traditional oral history projects via a meaningful collision with electronic media, creating a space not only for the preservation of memory and experience (a lofty aim in and of itself) but also for emergent modes of interpretation and knowledge management.  For instance, the site's 'map browser' allows users to pinpoint the geographic location of a story or an image, while also inviting a comparative analysis of how different neighborhoods or regions were impacted.  The site's search function allows this archive to respond to its viewers own interests and desires, while the 'contribute' field encourages additions and reflections, opening the collection up to expansion and growth.  To date, many of the pieces published in Vectors in some way work as analogues to more traditional scholarly artifacts, re-making and re-imagining the article in rich multimedia dimensions or supplementing the constraints of the monograph via an expanded archive.  Projects like this one push in another direction that the journal is eager to explore, toward a more connected and networked scholarly vernacular.   HDMB simultaneously displays and extends the pioneering work undertaken by the Center for History and New Media at George Mason University.  Since the early 1990s, the Center has actively modeled vibrant new modes of public history while exploring the power of the internet to expand our conceptions of what counts in and as an archive.  Their work troubles a number of binaries long reified by history scholars (and humanities scholars more generally), including one/many, closed/open, expert/amateur, scholarship/journalism, and research/pedagogy.

Further, he found that a city's \"imageability,\" which is linked to the presence of legible and identifiable kinds of markers, contributes to a sense of familiarity and the acceptance of the city as a recognizable place. Todd Presner's Hypermedia Berlin extends Lynch's ideas through the creation of a series of layered maps of Berlin that not only chronicle the evolution and dissolution of the city's districts, architectural landmarks and boundaries through multiple chronologies, but that also reflect the city through diverging ideological lenses. The project, designed to be shared with students and instructors internationally, offers a new form of scholarship in which \"visitors\" discover the city's multifaceted history through its sedimented terrain. Rather than moving through the histories traditionally arrayed in linear text, Hypermedia Berlin invites users to begin in the streets, parks and landmarks that constitute the city and then to move either up or down on a temporal axis almost decade by decade, or outward, from one place to another.

The project can be understood as a multimedia descendent of Walter Benjamin's famous attempt to map the Paris of the nineteenth century in the Arcades Project.  Explicitly disavowing any kind of linear, chronological, or teleological model of historiography, \"Hypermedia Berlin,\" like the Arcades Project, is organized topographically in order to examine the complex relationship between cultural production, mobility, and space.  While Benjamin attempted to create a \"montage\" text to study Paris, I am proposing that the technologies of the Web and new media offer the possibility of conceptualizing a radically new approach to cultural history, something that Benjamin was not able to fully realize in the Arcades Project.  I have to believe that Benjamin would have found the tools of new media, specifically the rhizomatic techniques of hypertext and the hypermedia possibilities of the World Wide Web, especially well suited to \"giving dates their physiognomy\" and realizing what he once called \"the Copernican revolution in historical perception.\"\"Hypermedia Berlin\" is organized according to \"Zeitschichten,\" or time-layers, in which the uneven spatial and temporal coordinates of Berlin's cultural and architectural histories can be apprehended.  Unlike traditional models of history, which proceed chronologically and take the linearity of temporality as their structuring principle, \"Hypermedia Berlin\" attempts to articulate Berlin's time-layers through a multiplicity of maps connected together by interlinking \"hotspots\" at key regions, structures, and streets.  These maps function as historical palimpsests of the city, thereby spatializing historical practice and transforming cultural history into a kind of \"cultural geography.\"  With the technical support of UCLA's Center for Digital Humanities as well as the financial support of UCLA's Academic Senate Faculty Grants Program, UCLA's Office of Instructional Development, and the Stanford Humanities Laboratory, the pilot version of \"Hypermedia Berlin\" was launched in the spring of 2004.  I initially conceived of the project as a \"Hypermedia-Hypertextbook\" of Berlin for use in the classroom.  To this end, we began developing an extensive digital archive of interconnected maps and photographs of Berlin.  As the project rapidly grew, it quickly became apparent that we would need to develop a content management system to edit, search, and present the vast amount of material.  Moreover, we needed a way for students, researchers, and the general public to interact with and contribute to the site.  We are currently developing the first content management system for \"Hypermedia Berlin.\"  In addition to about fifty interconnected and fully annotated maps of Berlin over its nearly 800-year history, the site will include a digital library interface with a searchable database of photographs, an e-scholarship interface with peer-reviewed essays in hypertext format, an extensive blogger function for general authorship, and a customizable \"My-Hypermedia Berlin\" that will allow teachers and students interested in any aspect of Berlin to excerpt and create their own course or research material.  We hope to launch the content management system within a year, something that will distinguish \"Hypermedia Berlin\" as a unique research and curriculum development portal on the city.  For my Vectors' contribution, I created a Flash film of the first phase of the project in which I discuss both the pedagogical and research challenges that this media presents for historical methodology, disciplinary practice, and classroom pedagogy.  The film runs about 15 minutes and can be paused, fast-forwarded, or rewound.  To view the film, just launch the project.

Other projects at CDH have taken inspiration from the time-map interface, and we are confident that the technology we have developed for mapping Berlin will be put to good use in other upcoming projects examining the relationship between space, mobility, and culture.— Design Team","collection":"pièces"},{"id":"in-the-news","url":"http://vectorsjournal.org/projects/index.php?project=50","titre":"In The News","personnes":"Michal Migurski , Eric Rodenbeck","citation":"\\r\\nEditor's IntroductionElectronic media like the internet extend television's promise of liveness, structuring a sense of a connected presence in time that users come to feel they somehow control and move through in the click or the scroll.

'The news\" flies by us continously, from thousands of different sources, and often passes out of sight as the next topic rolls forward. This real-time, always-on state of affairs greatly adds to a sense of connectedness to \"what's happening now,\" especially during times of high interest in the news - but it can be difficult to make sense of it all, especially given the wide variety of news sources available.Google.com's solution to this problem is an online news aggregator. Drawing from 4,500 different online sources, their search algorithms compare stories across multiple news feeds, collect similar articles into clusters, and update the results every 15 minutes. The result is a remarkable real-time aggregation of what's \"in the news\" at any given moment.The thrill of real-time news is certainly real - but this window into the news' continuous flow can engender a sense of flatness and superficiality in relation to the world. Looking at online news in this way, the time is always now - and what's on now is all that matters. A broader understanding of the news requires deeper analysis, and the maintenance of an historical record to support that analysis.Stamen's In The News project seeks to address this issue by providing two kinds of visualizations:”¢ what's making news headlines right now, and”¢ what made headlines yesterday, and in the days before that.The project collates the data from google's \"In The News\" sidebar every 15 minutes. Since these updates happen on a regular schedule, every day, the relative incidence of each term may be shown as a larger or smaller box in a simple bar chart representing a single day:Juxtaposing the current day's bar chart with the previous day's allows for easy visual comparison, and terms are color-coded depending on whether they are rising or falling relative to the previous day's proportions. In the graphic below, the current incidence of \"Sinn Fein\" has increased since the previous day, so it is colored red:Over time, a visual mapping of a news items' prominence is built, allowing for immediate visual cues as to the progress of a term over a week. Each selection generates a sparkline underneath the week's visualization, allowing for the ability to understand multiple simultaneous trends in a weekly news cycle, with links back to google's results for that term:What we start to see is that by continuously pulling small, discreet, commonly formatted pieces of data together, information can not only be visualized, but built up over time, dynamically, providing additional levels of depth and meaning. And these displays can be set up in such a way that they're always current - they provide a continuously updated visualization that not only provides a snapshot of the current state of a system, but can build these snapshots into something more interesting. It's important to note that this data is not published by google in a manner intended for re-publication. These visualizations require custom-built scrapers to gather and coallate the data. Nevertheless, this information is out there - google news is only one of many sources that could be used to create these kinds of presentation views.The project opens up the potential for a wide variety of questions which could be asked and answered via these kinds of mechanisms. For example: news stories could be tracked not only by how many times they show up in google news, but how often they show up in different media sources - exposing a relative bias in groups of media organizations. Other events could be mapped to these news terms - it might be interesting to view historical stock market data relative to the rise and fall of certain news stories over time.A desire for this kind of visualization has some precedent - Julius Civitatus famously [mapped] George Bush's approval ratings to terror alerts in 2004, and there are many other examples.

These flickering screens are deeply meaningful experiments in time-based media, animating text long before the past decade's explosion of software packages made screen movement seem inevitable.  They are also environmental media, specific to the places they inhabit; we might understand them as early investigations into ubiquitous computing, particularly given the labor-intensive programming required to realize any single LED work.  Jenny Holzer at the Neue Nationalgalerie explores these and other meanings of Holzer's work via a multi-perspectival documentation of a specific exhibition at a precise moment in space and time.Combining video, animation, scholarly essays, photographs, and a wealth of other information, the project at one level functions as a multimedia catalog or database, deploying many forms of media to 'preserve' the inherently ephemeral experience of the art exhibition.  This kind of 'thick description' allows multiple points of entry into both the Neue Nationalgalerie exhibit and into Holzer's work more generally.  But Jenny Holzer at the Neue Nationalgalerie does more than simply present evidence that this exhibition did indeed happen.  Like all of the projects in this first issue of Vectors, it also implies an argument about the relationship between evidence and interface.  In selecting what perspectives and artifacts would be included and in deciding how to structure access to these elements, the project privileges modes of presentation in dialogue with contemporary scholarship in performance studies, art history, and cultural studies.  In detailing the sustained and collaborative labor involved in the construction of Holzer's LEDs, the piece reminds us of the often-invisible work that underlies our experiences of media and of art, something much less obvious to the visitors immersed in the dreamy modernists spaces of the original installation.  In that regard, it shares with The Stolen Time Archive a precise goal: the desire to always remember the material in our engagements with the ephemeral.-- Tara McPherson and Steve Anderson\\\\n\\r\\nAuthor's StatementWhy Jenny Holzer, why a retrospective at Berlin's Neue Nationalgalerie, why an electronic journal, and why all three coming together in Vectors' inaugural issue devoted to 'evidence\"?  Framing an answer brings to mind some phrases from Holzer's signature early work, Truisms.   First:  \"DESCRIPTION IS MORE VALUABLE THAN METAPHOR.\"  Like all of Holzer's truisms, some rhetorical seduction and sleight-of-hand are at work here.  The phrase sounds so authoritative; it seems to compel assent; it must be true.  But what's the context?  Is the statement really a self-evident absolute truth; or is it only true in specific instances?  What is missing is deixis, the extralinguistic indication of evidence that would allow you, the addressee of the phrase, to figure out the reference, context, and truth-value of the supposed truism.  Seen from one perspective, I think this truism actually says a lot about how Gwen Allen and I, the organizers of this project, tried to proceed methodologically.  In the website, we place a premium on pointing.  We like the indexical gesture, the gesture that simply points at the evidence and says to the reader:  here is what it is, now you need to contextualize it, to put your own signature on it.  It also seems to us that multimedia documentation is particularly useful for making an indexical gesture.  In lieu of having to use a 1000 words to describe a picture of the Holzer installation, we can present a photograph, animation, or video and then be able to say, \"here, take a look.\"But there is, ultimately, a limit to the usefulness of just pointing.  Or, perhaps more precisely, there is a limit to the idea that one can simply point and do nothing else.  Basically, pointing presupposes framing.  Another way to say this is that description always implies metaphor, and metaphor always implies description.  One cannot describe without selecting out certain things to describe.  Description is always from a perspective. As a result, it is always comparative to other perspectives.  Metaphor is comparison, and to the extent that any pointing and describing requires a comparative theory for selecting what to point at and describe, description entails metaphor.  Pointing already entails interpretation.   Evidence is not simply what is seen; evidence is what is pulled out of the whole field of the seen and shown to be important.  Ex + videre = out of + to see.   Ironically, a 1000 words are sometimes more important than a single picture.So . . . in designing the Holzer site, we had to deal with the question of how our pointing at and framing of evidence, i.e. our interface, implies an interpretation of that evidence.  Another truism:  \"A SINGLE EVENT CAN HAVE INFINITELY MANY INTERPRETATIONS.\"  Again, we tried to take this to heart.  We asked a whole variety of contributors, all from slightly different backgrounds, to offer different lenses on how to perceive Holzer's work at the Nationalgalerie.  And rather than treat one lens as more important than another, we tried to be egalitarian.  Consequently our interface does not demand that a visitor read one person's response before another.  There is no single way that a person has to go through the site.  So while the use of multimedia evidence allows us to privilege the gesture of pointing, the hyperlinked structure of the web allows us to de-privilege a hierarchical structure of argument.But there is a catch to this truism as well.  Although a single event can have infinite interpretations, that does not actually mean that each one of them is equally valid.  I do believe that all of the interpretations of Holzer's installation offered on our site are valid and, perhaps, equally valid.  But saying that does not mean we were able to extricate ourselves from making some hierarchical choices.  There actually is a hierarchical organization implied in the interface of our menu bar.  One way to interact with the site is simply to move progressively down the menu bar from the \"Home\" to the \"Bibliography.\"  Doing so offers the visitor a more or less chronological sense of how the installation at the Neue Nationalgalerie was conceived, worked out in the planning stages, installed, received, and finally archived.   The web may aspire to be free-floating; the interactivity of the web may aspire to put as much interpretive power on the side of the receiver as on that of the sender; but there is structure.  The infinity of possible interpretations is a closed infinity, rather than an open one.And yet . . . \"DON'T PLACE TOO MUCH TRUST IN EXPERTS.\"  Please do not think that a chronological approach is an authoritative approach.  As Gwen Allen makes clear in her critical essay about the exhibition, digital technology in particular and technologies of reproduction in general complicate the relative natures of past, present, and future.  That quasi-truism is one of the theses about evidence that this site attempts to make manifest.  We believe we've given you enough evidence to trust our interpretations.  Whether we have is, in the end, at least one interpretation left to you. -- Ehren Fordyce\\\\n\\r\\nDesigner's StatementMy goal as designer/programmer was to build a site that served as a virtual record, a interactive documentary snapshot, of Holzer's installation at the Berlin Neue Nationalgalerie.  The site features a clean, functional interface that is both easy to use and attuned to Holzer's and Mies Van Der Rohe's modernist aesthetics.  The site is also dynamically driven and therefore scalable; content can be modified, added or removed with relative ease as new information or scholarly research becomes available.  -- Alessandro CegliaAlessandro was born in Milan, Italy and educated in the U.S.  He received his B.A. from Dartmouth College in Art History and Asian Studies, and then spent five years abroad in various parts of Asia and Europe.

This kind of 'thick description' allows multiple points of entry into both the Neue Nationalgalerie exhibit and into Holzer's work more generally.  But Jenny Holzer at the Neue Nationalgalerie does more than simply present evidence that this exhibition did indeed happen.  Like all of the projects in this first issue of Vectors, it also implies an argument about the relationship between evidence and interface.  In selecting what perspectives and artifacts would be included and in deciding how to structure access to these elements, the project privileges modes of presentation in dialogue with contemporary scholarship in performance studies, art history, and cultural studies.  In detailing the sustained and collaborative labor involved in the construction of Holzer's LEDs, the piece reminds us of the often-invisible work that underlies our experiences of media and of art, something much less obvious to the visitors immersed in the dreamy modernists spaces of the original installation.  In that regard, it shares with The Stolen Time Archive a precise goal: the desire to always remember the material in our engagements with the ephemeral.-- Tara McPherson and Steve Anderson\\\\n\\r\\nAuthor's StatementWhy Jenny Holzer, why a retrospective at Berlin's Neue Nationalgalerie, why an electronic journal, and why all three coming together in Vectors' inaugural issue devoted to 'evidence\"?  Framing an answer brings to mind some phrases from Holzer's signature early work, Truisms.   First:  \"DESCRIPTION IS MORE VALUABLE THAN METAPHOR.\"  Like all of Holzer's truisms, some rhetorical seduction and sleight-of-hand are at work here.  The phrase sounds so authoritative; it seems to compel assent; it must be true.  But what's the context?  Is the statement really a self-evident absolute truth; or is it only true in specific instances?  What is missing is deixis, the extralinguistic indication of evidence that would allow you, the addressee of the phrase, to figure out the reference, context, and truth-value of the supposed truism.  Seen from one perspective, I think this truism actually says a lot about how Gwen Allen and I, the organizers of this project, tried to proceed methodologically.  In the website, we place a premium on pointing.  We like the indexical gesture, the gesture that simply points at the evidence and says to the reader:  here is what it is, now you need to contextualize it, to put your own signature on it.  It also seems to us that multimedia documentation is particularly useful for making an indexical gesture.  In lieu of having to use a 1000 words to describe a picture of the Holzer installation, we can present a photograph, animation, or video and then be able to say, \"here, take a look.\"But there is, ultimately, a limit to the usefulness of just pointing.  Or, perhaps more precisely, there is a limit to the idea that one can simply point and do nothing else.  Basically, pointing presupposes framing.  Another way to say this is that description always implies metaphor, and metaphor always implies description.  One cannot describe without selecting out certain things to describe.  Description is always from a perspective. As a result, it is always comparative to other perspectives.  Metaphor is comparison, and to the extent that any pointing and describing requires a comparative theory for selecting what to point at and describe, description entails metaphor.  Pointing already entails interpretation.   Evidence is not simply what is seen; evidence is what is pulled out of the whole field of the seen and shown to be important.  Ex + videre = out of + to see.   Ironically, a 1000 words are sometimes more important than a single picture.So . . . in designing the Holzer site, we had to deal with the question of how our pointing at and framing of evidence, i.e. our interface, implies an interpretation of that evidence.  Another truism:  \"A SINGLE EVENT CAN HAVE INFINITELY MANY INTERPRETATIONS.\"  Again, we tried to take this to heart.  We asked a whole variety of contributors, all from slightly different backgrounds, to offer different lenses on how to perceive Holzer's work at the Nationalgalerie.  And rather than treat one lens as more important than another, we tried to be egalitarian.  Consequently our interface does not demand that a visitor read one person's response before another.  There is no single way that a person has to go through the site.  So while the use of multimedia evidence allows us to privilege the gesture of pointing, the hyperlinked structure of the web allows us to de-privilege a hierarchical structure of argument.But there is a catch to this truism as well.  Although a single event can have infinite interpretations, that does not actually mean that each one of them is equally valid.  I do believe that all of the interpretations of Holzer's installation offered on our site are valid and, perhaps, equally valid.  But saying that does not mean we were able to extricate ourselves from making some hierarchical choices.  There actually is a hierarchical organization implied in the interface of our menu bar.  One way to interact with the site is simply to move progressively down the menu bar from the \"Home\" to the \"Bibliography.\"  Doing so offers the visitor a more or less chronological sense of how the installation at the Neue Nationalgalerie was conceived, worked out in the planning stages, installed, received, and finally archived.   The web may aspire to be free-floating; the interactivity of the web may aspire to put as much interpretive power on the side of the receiver as on that of the sender; but there is structure.  The infinity of possible interpretations is a closed infinity, rather than an open one.And yet . . . \"DON'T PLACE TOO MUCH TRUST IN EXPERTS.\"  Please do not think that a chronological approach is an authoritative approach.  As Gwen Allen makes clear in her critical essay about the exhibition, digital technology in particular and technologies of reproduction in general complicate the relative natures of past, present, and future.  That quasi-truism is one of the theses about evidence that this site attempts to make manifest.  We believe we've given you enough evidence to trust our interpretations.  Whether we have is, in the end, at least one interpretation left to you. -- Ehren Fordyce\\\\n\\r\\nDesigner's StatementMy goal as designer/programmer was to build a site that served as a virtual record, a interactive documentary snapshot, of Holzer's installation at the Berlin Neue Nationalgalerie.  The site features a clean, functional interface that is both easy to use and attuned to Holzer's and Mies Van Der Rohe's modernist aesthetics.  The site is also dynamically driven and therefore scalable; content can be modified, added or removed with relative ease as new information or scholarly research becomes available.  -- Alessandro CegliaAlessandro was born in Milan, Italy and educated in the U.S.  He received his B.A. from Dartmouth College in Art History and Asian Studies, and then spent five years abroad in various parts of Asia and Europe.

How to provide access to such a diverse and extensive range of work? How to insert commentary, context and background information while preserving the raw power of the original videos? In response to these challenges, author Jennifer Terry and designer Raegan Kelly developed a rhetoric of connection and accretion which resists linearity and the seductiveness of a single argument illustrated with evidence. Users are led toward no single interpretation; no replacement ideology takes over from that of the Administration's party line. Indeed the text allows for and even encourages responses based in idiosyncracy and uncertainty. The source material presented here all comes from 'the Internet,\" but what does that mean? What can it mean? Which of the sites hosting these materials are \"real\" and which are run by counter-intelligence agencies hoping to track usage patterns among potential dissidents via IP addresses? Terry's text also refuses the screen-media convention of text that has been reduced to digestible lexia. The micronarratives, profiles and backstories that make up Terry's analysis, like the unedited videos themselves, insist on a certain investment of time, thought and connection-making. Curiosity and patience are rewarded with a rare feeling that one is not simply the conduit for one of several predetermined responses being called up by mainstream media or academic commentary. In an age when the Google search engine can claim to return over 6 million references to \"iraq war\" in \"(0.11 seconds),\" the issue no longer seems to be gaining access to information so much as knowing what to do when we have it at our fingertips. Part of the power of Terry's commentary lies in the flat understatement of her text. When she drops raw figures -- such as the fact that coalition forces have fired more than 250,000 bullets for every \"insurgent\" killed in Iraq -- the number seems to hang impossibly on the page. The point is not to dramatize, shock or dismay, but to suggest the importance of educating ourselves out of our narrowness of concern. The Iraq war is happening now -- with men and women killing and dying in our names whether we like it or not. We owe it to them, at the very least, to watch, read, listen, think, and then decide for ourselves exactly how we intend to act.— Vectors Journal Editorial Staff\\\\n\\n\\t\\n\\tKiller Entertainments\\n\\t\\nBy Jennifer Terry\\nDesign by Raegan KellyAuthor's StatementThis project is concerned with critical reading strategies and their importance for understanding evolving modes of visualization and evolving modes of war. Using methods from Cultural Studies, I offer some tools for decoding the material we've gathered for you to see. Cultural Studies calls into question the taken-for-granted nature of things in order to map how power and knowledge come together, or rather how power-knowledge materializes in thoughts, ideas, images, identities, products, and relations. As a field, Cultural Studies promotes critical reflection upon the production of meaning, assuming cultures to be constituted through dynamics of difference, rather than being homogenous or static entities. Culture is a contested terrain, to paraphrase Stuart Hall. Conflicts over meaning involve social subjects -- individual people and other agents of social relations (such as universities, religious congregations, corporations, militaries, families, etc.)  -- and changing (sometimes volatile) systems of signification. These conflicts may be more visible in the context of crisis. In the case of the mediated space you are about to enter in Killer Entertainments, the crisis is that of increasingly unpopular wars in Iraq and Afghanistan waged on what are now generally regarded as either insufficient, discrepant, or downright false pretenses. What I have tried to do here is to show how the visual codes pertaining to these wars are in the grain of other popular entertainments that may indeed serve to make the violence of war something that we have already incorporated into daily life and bodily practice, but of whose many effects we remain disturbingly unaware.Culture Studies uses critical reading practices to locate texts in contexts. This is accomplished by paying attention to three main dimensions of cultural production: the textual (or formal) properties of a given cultural product, the political economy that affords its production, and the product's reception by its consumers. Textual analysis examines how an image is framed, lit, organized, displayed, or placed in relation to other images. It focuses on what the image or text actually displays, i.e. its content. It allows for polysemic readings -- different or multiple interpretations of an image or text. An analysis of its political economy takes stock of what it costs to make a product, that is, the values that enabled the production of the product. This dimension of analysis may look at 'culture industries\" (television, films, music, gaming). It notices where money is invested, and who is in charge of spending and making it. It pays attention to market-building and techniques for selling cultural products. It analyzes the development of technology -- its cost, intended purpose, its marketing (e.g. cable TV, satellite dishes, cameras, computers, wireless devices, etc.). It pays attention to how economic power links up to formal political power, for example, in instances of censorship, regulation, and the official circulation of certain cultural products such as movies, TV shows, computer games, advertisements, and recorded music. It asks who and what kinds of cultural products are marginalized as a result of who controls the money (i.e. how \"underground,\" \"independent\" or \"alternative\" media are produced).An analysis of audience reception takes into consideration how consumers of a product or system make sense of what they are consuming and may, in turn, subvert the intended uses of what they receive, wittingly or unwittingly. As Cultural Studies has it, viewers and consumers are part of the system of cultural production, not passive receivers or mere end points of a unidirectional trajectory. Therefore, audience reception analysis looks at the ways that specific cultural products are developed to appeal to certain audiences -- i.e. how they construct certain audiences rather than merely discover already constituted groups of people. This approach also reveals how mass media are geared toward dominant or \"mainstream\" audiences -- i.e. how mass media transform ideological assertions into cultural assumptions. And it reveals how corporate-controlled media often work to marginalize certain individuals and audiences. It also reveals how certain audiences actively resist or creatively appropriate cultural products against the intentions of their designers. Specific audiences may \"read against the grain\" of a text, producing a variety of readings that differ from the intentions of those who originally conceived and sold the product.These three analytical dimensions of Cultural Studies methodology are embedded in the technique I use for decoding the video clips that you are about to encounter. Raegan Kelly's design invites viewers to interact with my decoding techniques in relation to specific clips. Raegan and I invite you to consider these decodings critically and to compare them with your own situated perspectives on what you are seeing, hearing, feeling, and thinking about this material. There is much more that could be said about what you are going to encounter. We offer a modest but critical window into what is very likely to be an expanding world of performative images of violent conflict in what one commentator has referred to as \"the first YouTube war.\" Before we go further, though, I want to say a few words about the material we've collected, and to let you in on some of the decisions Raegan and I made about how to organize the piece. The main logic that governs the textual interventions I wrote for this piece is captured in a broad question: \"What would viewers benefit from knowing in order to make sense of what they are watching?\"So first, we sought to contextualize the clips at various levels. We found that most of the video clips of combat that are uploaded to popular video-sharing sites are radically decontextualized. We learn very little about where they occurred, when they occurred, who is taking the footage, who is fighting, and why they are fighting. Some videos offer information that is either not very specific or inaccurate. Only a few are date- and time-stamped at the beginning of the clip, as in the B-roll material collected by the U.S. Army Mobile Public Affairs Detachment units. Some are posted months and even years after the event occurred, and therefore can be mistaken for occurring on the date they were posted, not when they were shot.These decontextualizing moves, while perhaps not intentional, are linked to a process of obfuscation or mystification, whereby the spectacle dominates the field of knowledge and the histories and differing rationalities of the warring groups are submerged into obscurity. The operation of military occupation sets the stage for Manichean logics to become materialized in image-making and image-circulation -- if a video clip offers no information about the historical or political context in which its action takes place, the likelihood of simplistic racist and xenophobic logics organizing the viewing practice increases. I have attempted to offer various kinds of contextualizing information about the videos in order to interrupt a mystification process that is at the heart of warfare waged on the basis of a particular kind of xenophobic logic. You will find various kinds of information to contextualize a particular video by clicking on the red and brown buttons that appear as the clip rolls. Some elements of context recur when they are relevant to more than one video or segment.Most of the clips selected for inclusion here are raw footage -- that is footage that is not heavily edited and is without a voice-over narration or musical soundtrack. The exception are clips produced by the Islamic Army of Iraq. All of the clips we've included are readily available on the internet for streaming or downloading. We chose them in order to provide a range of kinds of clips so that you may see footage taken from the cockpit of an aerial vehicle, or from a helmet-mounted camera, or from a camera mounted on an SUV's dashboard or a tank's turret. Many of the clips are taken with hand-held portable video cameras of consumer quality. Some of the clips are classified as \"B roll\" by military videographers who work as embedded reporters following the activities of units to which they are assigned. They are officially authorized clips but, as you can see, they are not necessarily organized into finished pieces. A lot of the footage is taken by amateurs who are learning as they go.We have chosen also to include a number of clips produced by groups opposed to the U.S. occupation in Iraq, including the Islamic Army of Iraq and an unnamed Shi'a resistance group. These are included so that viewers can compare the formal properties and content elements to those in clips made by U.S. soldiers. I use the function of onscreen commentary to point out stylistic distinctions and their relationship to specific geopolitical factors in the region. In some instances, I point out similarities between \"Jihad\" clips and those produced by U.S. soldiers. This allows viewers to see a kind of cross-fire between sequences produced by combatants in various positions in the war. A substantial number of the clips were taken by U.S. soldiers in Iraq and Afghanistan who happened to have cameras and wanted to capture images of their experiences to send home to friends and family. These are technically unofficial materials that are distributed on commercial video-sharing websites. They are subject to restrictions according to Pentagon policy governing the appropriate use of the internet and other outlets when it comes to posting material about the war. In essence the policy makes commanding officers responsible for monitoring the blogging, chatting, and video-sharing activities of those under their command. The \"Loose Lips Sink Ships\" doctrine is a primary guide here: written, spoken, or photographed material that discloses the location and goals of operations still under way or that divulges strategic information that could endanger an operation or the soldiers involves is forbidden from being posted. Those who violate the policy are subject to punishment. But monitoring is done on a local level and commanding officers tend to rely on an honor system to keep restricted material out of circulation. That means a lot of images are available for all to see on the internet, including a substantial amount of grisly and disturbing material. Much of the video footage that is posted to the internet is of operations that are already completed or whose date and location remain unspecified. It seems that much of the footage from the first few years of the war in Iraq was posted when troops came back to the U.S. Now, however, it is not unusual to find footage posted to places like militaryvideos.com, liveleak.com, and YouTube.com that is date-marked just a few days before it appears. This has partly to do with how easy it has become to upload video clips onto these sites -- something that wasn't as easy back in 2003 when band-width was hard to come by and few people knew about video-sharing sites. But it also may indicate that the people in the U.S. military, whether they are commanding officers or ground troops, recognize that a growing sector of the public is interested in watching war footage and seeking other sources of news about the war beyond mainstream news outlets, which are either accused of being overly pessimistic about the war, as conservative critics claim, or pandering to the ideological agenda of the Bush administration, as many on the left believe.It is evident that the portable video camera is part of the arsenal of war. Images of combat are used by all sides in the conflict strategically to document operations, to prove the effectiveness of particular violent techniques, to inspire adherents to one's cause, and to mock or intimidate one's opponents. They are part of larger psychological and affective dimensions of this kind of war which is perhaps more photographed than any conflict which has preceded it and whose avenues of documentation crisscross with those of entertainment, religious observation, and transnational identity formation occurring within but also far from the actual site of bloody conflict. When so many have cameras and so many have viewing screens, the \"B roll\" of the war is radically dispersed and becomes an integral instrument in the waging of war.We decided not to include examples of a large group of clips produced by U.S. troops and their supporters that follow a basic formula resembling music videos. There are hundreds of these on the internet, available from many of the sites I list below. Many are slideshow compilations set to a single song or a musical soundtrack -- usually \"emo rock\" anthems or thrash metal tunes with angry lyrics. I encourage viewers to take a look at some of these, and have provided links to a few of them at the end of this introduction. I hesitate to characterize them en masse because there are many stylistic variations among them. But they do share a common appeal to affect, though the resulting outcome of that appeal may vary from viewer to viewer. Based on the commentary section that appears below the viewing screen on which they appear, many are cheered for their patriotic prowess and powerful projection of U.S. military might. Some are credited by viewers as especially sensitive and meaningful, when they show the daily interactions of troops with one another or with Iraqi people who seem to welcome them. Others are technofetishistic, with speeded up images of jets flying through the air and dropping bombs or tanks traveling through villages and shooting off mortars into ruined buildings. It is common to see a photo of a G.I. smiling and showing off a rocket inscribed with phrases such as \"die, raghead, die!\" interjected between sequences of exploding bombs and frantic fire fights. In many ways, these amateur edited multi-media texts have much in common with videos compiled and posted by the Islamic Army in Iraq or other groups associated with the \"electronic mujihadeen\" that use music and scriptural text captions to enhance the affective or emotional appeal of the piece. I regard these edited video clips as no less or more meaningful (and no more or less \"real\") than the minimally edited footage that I have focused my analysis on in this piece. Their meanings must be decoded, sometimes using different kinds of tools than those applied to the minimally edited footage. What I wanted to do is to draw attention to the temporality and the affect signified without heavy editing involved. This seemed to me a greater challenge partly because the texts' instabilities and contingencies were more apparent than might be evident in footage subjected to processes of heavy editing. The insecurity of the footage -- its instability -- indicates something about the bodies of the endangered participants in the scenes being captured. Even when bodies do not appear -- and this is true in many of the clips we've chosen -- there is a vulnerability that is palpable, whose meaning is subject to analysis and decoding. Authoring, co-authoring, re-authoring, appropriating. Video editing and sharing software have brought these functions together in ways that are manifestly evident in the universe of combat footage. It is not uncommon to find combat clips that are edited and provided with a musical soundtrack, or to find an opponent's video clips that are appropriated and re-scripted into the ideological framework of the re-authored production. For example, I found a clip that appropriates footage originally taken by an anti-occupation group and confiscated after the group's members were killed. For the first half of the nearly six minute tape, we see the typical footage produced by insurgents documenting the planning of operations to detonate vehicles through IEDs, etc. About two-thirds of the way through, a caption reading \"this is what happens if you fuck with us\" appears, followed by a series of still photographs of dead men, bloody body parts, bombed out cars, and captured weapons caches. It ends abruptly with a caption reading, \"if you want some come get some bitches.\" At the time I am writing this, the clip is available at http://www.liveleak.com/view?i=60fd7b9937. Another famous example is the use of photographs, once censored by the Pentagon, of rows of flag-wrapped caskets containing bodies of U.S. troops, loaded into C-130 aircraft returning to the military morgue in Dover, Delaware. It is not uncommon to find these images, taken by Americans working for the U.S. government in Iraq, in videos produced by anti-occupation groups from Iraq and the region. They are often deployed to address a potentially sympathetic audience of Americans who are angry with the Bush administration's denials about the real costs of war.The video clips are a kind of ephemera. They may appear one minute, be cut into various pieces, re-authored, circulated, and then even disappear. I'm faced with a dilemma posed to ethnographers working in field sites: it is impossible to conduct the same interviews again or to have identical field observations happen in different moments. But, moreover, with the cut and mix re-authoring availed by new digital technologies, the clips take on a palimpsestic quality, as you will experience in their moments of freezing, fading, and repeating. Each shifted iteration -- uploading, downloading, uploading again, streaming, etc. -- offers a a trace of a kind of re-authoring, only the author may be not a person but is likely to be a ghost or erratic code in the machine.One can easily predict that the kinds of footage included in this piece will become quotidian, if they haven't already for some of you who are reading this. But this project was undertaken at the beginning of a new chapter in the relationship between representation, media technologies, and violent conflict. I started it just as video sharing social networking sites were beginning to attract what have grown to be millions of viewers, many of whom are producers of media images themselves, though mostly having amateur skills levels. The advent of affordable video cameras, desk top editing software, high speed digital transmission vectors, and fascination with the homemade spectacle are elements that converge and take material form in the clips we've gathered.  Since the phenomenon of making, uploading, and circulating images in such a mass dimension is a new development, my commentary may seem elementary and simplistic in a few years or even a few months, once we have all grown accustomed to being around this kind of material in a daily way. I shudder to think how I may be getting things dead wrong in my readings of this material, just as some early commentators on photography and cinema seem to have been way off track in retrospect. But this emergent social matrix that brings together cameras, computers, bodies, weapons, sentiments, and ideas seems worthy of reflection, even if it is tentative and not yet very sophisticated. Who makes these clips and who watches them? From what I have been able to discern, based on thousands of hours of surveying internet video-sharing sites, watching hundreds of video clips, and reading all that is available on videography and the current wars, it appears that most of the uploaded material is produced by men and, though this is harder to verify, most of it is watched by other men. This seems to hold for video clips taken by U.S. forces and for clips gathered by groups opposed to U.S. occupation. Though more women than ever are enlisted among the U.S. ranks, they don't seem to be taking video footage or at least uploading any of it to video-sharing sites. A few women who are trained as specialists in military public affairs receive official credit for their videography on B-roll of operations, but it seems mostly to be men and mostly white men who are uploading combat videos to the internet. In fact, women are almost never featured in the clips. They seldom appear in the clips posted by Jihad-identified groups, but occasionally they are shown assembling IEDs, as you will see in one of the clips we've included here.What does this indicate? Simply put, it reflects the gender demographics of the U.S. military and of the anti-occupation groups, which are overwhelmingly comprised of men. But it may also indicate something about the relationship of gender to technology, especially videography, editing, uploading, and surfing the internet. It's not unheard of but it is rare to find video clips narrated by or featuring African American or Latino soldiers -- male or female -- even though there are significant percentages of these groups in the military. The ranks of the trained and amateur videographers vary, but mostly they seem to be enlisted men (not officers) gathering footage of combat in order to document operations or to have a kind of war journal in which they record their experiences of war to send home or to have as souvenirs to remember the time later. This situation may change with time but for now it is an interesting symptom to consider, especially since posting video clips to the internet is one way of offering a perspective on the war. It will be interesting to see if women soldiers or soldiers of color or immigrant soldiers trading military duty for citizenship start to upload their own videos to the internet. And if they do, it will be interesting to see if their footage draws on different codes of signification, different kinds of soundtrack and music, different framing techniques, and different perspectives on war.Here is a list of some of the video sharing websites which post U.S. military or anti-occupation videos:  http://www.militaryvideos.nethttp://www.military.comhttp://www.liveleak.comhttp://www.youtube.comhttp://www.infovlad.nethttp://www.atwar.nethttp://www.dvidshub.net (Digital video and Imagery Distribution System)http://www.assaultonterror.orghttp://www.khaibar.orghttp://www.albasrah.nethttp://www.militaryspot.comhttp://www.terroristmedia.comhttp://www.militarytimes.comhttp://www. iraqiwarvideos.nethttp://www.grouchymedia.comFor an interesting documentary film on the subject, see MTV Iraq Uploaded: The War Network TV Won't Show You, Shot By Soldiers and Posted Online, July 2006, discussed at http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1536780/20060720/index.jhtml and featured in excerpts at http://www.ifilm.comHere are a few examples of music-video style productions using photography or video clips from combat.

Jenny put an astounding quantity of time in researching the materials and writing the texts of this piece, and the result is in my opinion a true gift to the reader. The videos we included are ephemeral in nature, difficult to pinpoint in terms of source, location, time, and degree from original, and rarely subjected to any form of cultural, critical or formal analysis (though widely viewed and discussed in mainstream media venues and more 'private' collective networks). Hence the three frame horizontal format, an attempt to provide you with an opportunity to make your own critical observations, to begin to apprehend affectively, visually, and intellectually some of the motivations and decisions driving both the production and the dissemination of these pieces. Many of them are difficult to watch, and both Jenny and I suffered at times from a sort of post-traumatic malaise, triggered for me by the horror of the scenes unfolding before me, and more so by a kind of fractured empathy in relation to subject position”'I feel so totally for the rarely seen but heard 'shooter' and (generally his) company while experiencing sometimes total repulsion at their actions and, especially, reactions. It is difficult, no matter how many times I watch these, to imagine the complete alteration of body chemistry and perceptual framework being physically *at war* must produce.It was a great pleasure to work with Jenny and I encourage you to spend time with this piece. As you watch, keyframes trigger access to ideas, formal analysis, and contextual information. A sidenote, some of the keyframes that have been carefully programmed to trigger don't, and occasionally videos 'stick' midstream. We have tried to flag this when it happens, as you can generally drag the seek bar a tiny bit to the right and see more. These video data streams have been copied by many people many times over, and compressed in this case for this format, and at times the stream becomes so thin the player can no longer detect it.— Raegan Kelly","citation_source_nom":"","citation_source_url":"","date":"2007","perspectives":"","mediums":"","materiaux":"","genres":"","pays":"","collections":"vectors-journal","organisations":"","video":"https://vimeo.com/180025973/8d0e91858b#t=6126s","images":["data/0fad6a30-83b0-4620-9e16-bdf011101e8c.png"],"preview":"","plateformes":"","tags":"cultural studies, étude des médias, vidéo, hypertexte","répertoires":"","technologies":"","description":"\\n\\t\\n\\tKiller Entertainments\\n\\t\\nBy Jennifer Terry\\nDesign by Raegan KellyEditor's IntroductionJennifer Terry's Killer Entertainments presents challenges to both designers and users on many levels.

Which of the sites hosting these materials are \"real\" and which are run by counter-intelligence agencies hoping to track usage patterns among potential dissidents via IP addresses? Terry's text also refuses the screen-media convention of text that has been reduced to digestible lexia. The micronarratives, profiles and backstories that make up Terry's analysis, like the unedited videos themselves, insist on a certain investment of time, thought and connection-making. Curiosity and patience are rewarded with a rare feeling that one is not simply the conduit for one of several predetermined responses being called up by mainstream media or academic commentary. In an age when the Google search engine can claim to return over 6 million references to \"iraq war\" in \"(0.11 seconds),\" the issue no longer seems to be gaining access to information so much as knowing what to do when we have it at our fingertips. Part of the power of Terry's commentary lies in the flat understatement of her text. When she drops raw figures -- such as the fact that coalition forces have fired more than 250,000 bullets for every \"insurgent\" killed in Iraq -- the number seems to hang impossibly on the page. The point is not to dramatize, shock or dismay, but to suggest the importance of educating ourselves out of our narrowness of concern. The Iraq war is happening now -- with men and women killing and dying in our names whether we like it or not. We owe it to them, at the very least, to watch, read, listen, think, and then decide for ourselves exactly how we intend to act.— Vectors Journal Editorial Staff\\\\n\\n\\t\\n\\tKiller Entertainments\\n\\t\\nBy Jennifer Terry\\nDesign by Raegan KellyAuthor's StatementThis project is concerned with critical reading strategies and their importance for understanding evolving modes of visualization and evolving modes of war. Using methods from Cultural Studies, I offer some tools for decoding the material we've gathered for you to see. Cultural Studies calls into question the taken-for-granted nature of things in order to map how power and knowledge come together, or rather how power-knowledge materializes in thoughts, ideas, images, identities, products, and relations. As a field, Cultural Studies promotes critical reflection upon the production of meaning, assuming cultures to be constituted through dynamics of difference, rather than being homogenous or static entities. Culture is a contested terrain, to paraphrase Stuart Hall. Conflicts over meaning involve social subjects -- individual people and other agents of social relations (such as universities, religious congregations, corporations, militaries, families, etc.)  -- and changing (sometimes volatile) systems of signification. These conflicts may be more visible in the context of crisis. In the case of the mediated space you are about to enter in Killer Entertainments, the crisis is that of increasingly unpopular wars in Iraq and Afghanistan waged on what are now generally regarded as either insufficient, discrepant, or downright false pretenses. What I have tried to do here is to show how the visual codes pertaining to these wars are in the grain of other popular entertainments that may indeed serve to make the violence of war something that we have already incorporated into daily life and bodily practice, but of whose many effects we remain disturbingly unaware.Culture Studies uses critical reading practices to locate texts in contexts. This is accomplished by paying attention to three main dimensions of cultural production: the textual (or formal) properties of a given cultural product, the political economy that affords its production, and the product's reception by its consumers. Textual analysis examines how an image is framed, lit, organized, displayed, or placed in relation to other images. It focuses on what the image or text actually displays, i.e. its content. It allows for polysemic readings -- different or multiple interpretations of an image or text. An analysis of its political economy takes stock of what it costs to make a product, that is, the values that enabled the production of the product. This dimension of analysis may look at 'culture industries\" (television, films, music, gaming). It notices where money is invested, and who is in charge of spending and making it. It pays attention to market-building and techniques for selling cultural products. It analyzes the development of technology -- its cost, intended purpose, its marketing (e.g. cable TV, satellite dishes, cameras, computers, wireless devices, etc.). It pays attention to how economic power links up to formal political power, for example, in instances of censorship, regulation, and the official circulation of certain cultural products such as movies, TV shows, computer games, advertisements, and recorded music. It asks who and what kinds of cultural products are marginalized as a result of who controls the money (i.e. how \"underground,\" \"independent\" or \"alternative\" media are produced).An analysis of audience reception takes into consideration how consumers of a product or system make sense of what they are consuming and may, in turn, subvert the intended uses of what they receive, wittingly or unwittingly. As Cultural Studies has it, viewers and consumers are part of the system of cultural production, not passive receivers or mere end points of a unidirectional trajectory. Therefore, audience reception analysis looks at the ways that specific cultural products are developed to appeal to certain audiences -- i.e. how they construct certain audiences rather than merely discover already constituted groups of people. This approach also reveals how mass media are geared toward dominant or \"mainstream\" audiences -- i.e. how mass media transform ideological assertions into cultural assumptions. And it reveals how corporate-controlled media often work to marginalize certain individuals and audiences. It also reveals how certain audiences actively resist or creatively appropriate cultural products against the intentions of their designers. Specific audiences may \"read against the grain\" of a text, producing a variety of readings that differ from the intentions of those who originally conceived and sold the product.These three analytical dimensions of Cultural Studies methodology are embedded in the technique I use for decoding the video clips that you are about to encounter. Raegan Kelly's design invites viewers to interact with my decoding techniques in relation to specific clips. Raegan and I invite you to consider these decodings critically and to compare them with your own situated perspectives on what you are seeing, hearing, feeling, and thinking about this material. There is much more that could be said about what you are going to encounter. We offer a modest but critical window into what is very likely to be an expanding world of performative images of violent conflict in what one commentator has referred to as \"the first YouTube war.\" Before we go further, though, I want to say a few words about the material we've collected, and to let you in on some of the decisions Raegan and I made about how to organize the piece. The main logic that governs the textual interventions I wrote for this piece is captured in a broad question: \"What would viewers benefit from knowing in order to make sense of what they are watching?\"So first, we sought to contextualize the clips at various levels. We found that most of the video clips of combat that are uploaded to popular video-sharing sites are radically decontextualized. We learn very little about where they occurred, when they occurred, who is taking the footage, who is fighting, and why they are fighting. Some videos offer information that is either not very specific or inaccurate. Only a few are date- and time-stamped at the beginning of the clip, as in the B-roll material collected by the U.S. Army Mobile Public Affairs Detachment units. Some are posted months and even years after the event occurred, and therefore can be mistaken for occurring on the date they were posted, not when they were shot.These decontextualizing moves, while perhaps not intentional, are linked to a process of obfuscation or mystification, whereby the spectacle dominates the field of knowledge and the histories and differing rationalities of the warring groups are submerged into obscurity. The operation of military occupation sets the stage for Manichean logics to become materialized in image-making and image-circulation -- if a video clip offers no information about the historical or political context in which its action takes place, the likelihood of simplistic racist and xenophobic logics organizing the viewing practice increases. I have attempted to offer various kinds of contextualizing information about the videos in order to interrupt a mystification process that is at the heart of warfare waged on the basis of a particular kind of xenophobic logic. You will find various kinds of information to contextualize a particular video by clicking on the red and brown buttons that appear as the clip rolls. Some elements of context recur when they are relevant to more than one video or segment.Most of the clips selected for inclusion here are raw footage -- that is footage that is not heavily edited and is without a voice-over narration or musical soundtrack. The exception are clips produced by the Islamic Army of Iraq. All of the clips we've included are readily available on the internet for streaming or downloading. We chose them in order to provide a range of kinds of clips so that you may see footage taken from the cockpit of an aerial vehicle, or from a helmet-mounted camera, or from a camera mounted on an SUV's dashboard or a tank's turret. Many of the clips are taken with hand-held portable video cameras of consumer quality. Some of the clips are classified as \"B roll\" by military videographers who work as embedded reporters following the activities of units to which they are assigned. They are officially authorized clips but, as you can see, they are not necessarily organized into finished pieces. A lot of the footage is taken by amateurs who are learning as they go.We have chosen also to include a number of clips produced by groups opposed to the U.S. occupation in Iraq, including the Islamic Army of Iraq and an unnamed Shi'a resistance group. These are included so that viewers can compare the formal properties and content elements to those in clips made by U.S. soldiers. I use the function of onscreen commentary to point out stylistic distinctions and their relationship to specific geopolitical factors in the region. In some instances, I point out similarities between \"Jihad\" clips and those produced by U.S. soldiers. This allows viewers to see a kind of cross-fire between sequences produced by combatants in various positions in the war. A substantial number of the clips were taken by U.S. soldiers in Iraq and Afghanistan who happened to have cameras and wanted to capture images of their experiences to send home to friends and family. These are technically unofficial materials that are distributed on commercial video-sharing websites. They are subject to restrictions according to Pentagon policy governing the appropriate use of the internet and other outlets when it comes to posting material about the war. In essence the policy makes commanding officers responsible for monitoring the blogging, chatting, and video-sharing activities of those under their command. The \"Loose Lips Sink Ships\" doctrine is a primary guide here: written, spoken, or photographed material that discloses the location and goals of operations still under way or that divulges strategic information that could endanger an operation or the soldiers involves is forbidden from being posted. Those who violate the policy are subject to punishment. But monitoring is done on a local level and commanding officers tend to rely on an honor system to keep restricted material out of circulation. That means a lot of images are available for all to see on the internet, including a substantial amount of grisly and disturbing material. Much of the video footage that is posted to the internet is of operations that are already completed or whose date and location remain unspecified. It seems that much of the footage from the first few years of the war in Iraq was posted when troops came back to the U.S. Now, however, it is not unusual to find footage posted to places like militaryvideos.com, liveleak.com, and YouTube.com that is date-marked just a few days before it appears. This has partly to do with how easy it has become to upload video clips onto these sites -- something that wasn't as easy back in 2003 when band-width was hard to come by and few people knew about video-sharing sites. But it also may indicate that the people in the U.S. military, whether they are commanding officers or ground troops, recognize that a growing sector of the public is interested in watching war footage and seeking other sources of news about the war beyond mainstream news outlets, which are either accused of being overly pessimistic about the war, as conservative critics claim, or pandering to the ideological agenda of the Bush administration, as many on the left believe.It is evident that the portable video camera is part of the arsenal of war. Images of combat are used by all sides in the conflict strategically to document operations, to prove the effectiveness of particular violent techniques, to inspire adherents to one's cause, and to mock or intimidate one's opponents. They are part of larger psychological and affective dimensions of this kind of war which is perhaps more photographed than any conflict which has preceded it and whose avenues of documentation crisscross with those of entertainment, religious observation, and transnational identity formation occurring within but also far from the actual site of bloody conflict. When so many have cameras and so many have viewing screens, the \"B roll\" of the war is radically dispersed and becomes an integral instrument in the waging of war.We decided not to include examples of a large group of clips produced by U.S. troops and their supporters that follow a basic formula resembling music videos. There are hundreds of these on the internet, available from many of the sites I list below. Many are slideshow compilations set to a single song or a musical soundtrack -- usually \"emo rock\" anthems or thrash metal tunes with angry lyrics. I encourage viewers to take a look at some of these, and have provided links to a few of them at the end of this introduction. I hesitate to characterize them en masse because there are many stylistic variations among them. But they do share a common appeal to affect, though the resulting outcome of that appeal may vary from viewer to viewer. Based on the commentary section that appears below the viewing screen on which they appear, many are cheered for their patriotic prowess and powerful projection of U.S. military might. Some are credited by viewers as especially sensitive and meaningful, when they show the daily interactions of troops with one another or with Iraqi people who seem to welcome them. Others are technofetishistic, with speeded up images of jets flying through the air and dropping bombs or tanks traveling through villages and shooting off mortars into ruined buildings. It is common to see a photo of a G.I. smiling and showing off a rocket inscribed with phrases such as \"die, raghead, die!\" interjected between sequences of exploding bombs and frantic fire fights. In many ways, these amateur edited multi-media texts have much in common with videos compiled and posted by the Islamic Army in Iraq or other groups associated with the \"electronic mujihadeen\" that use music and scriptural text captions to enhance the affective or emotional appeal of the piece. I regard these edited video clips as no less or more meaningful (and no more or less \"real\") than the minimally edited footage that I have focused my analysis on in this piece. Their meanings must be decoded, sometimes using different kinds of tools than those applied to the minimally edited footage. What I wanted to do is to draw attention to the temporality and the affect signified without heavy editing involved. This seemed to me a greater challenge partly because the texts' instabilities and contingencies were more apparent than might be evident in footage subjected to processes of heavy editing. The insecurity of the footage -- its instability -- indicates something about the bodies of the endangered participants in the scenes being captured. Even when bodies do not appear -- and this is true in many of the clips we've chosen -- there is a vulnerability that is palpable, whose meaning is subject to analysis and decoding. Authoring, co-authoring, re-authoring, appropriating. Video editing and sharing software have brought these functions together in ways that are manifestly evident in the universe of combat footage. It is not uncommon to find combat clips that are edited and provided with a musical soundtrack, or to find an opponent's video clips that are appropriated and re-scripted into the ideological framework of the re-authored production. For example, I found a clip that appropriates footage originally taken by an anti-occupation group and confiscated after the group's members were killed. For the first half of the nearly six minute tape, we see the typical footage produced by insurgents documenting the planning of operations to detonate vehicles through IEDs, etc. About two-thirds of the way through, a caption reading \"this is what happens if you fuck with us\" appears, followed by a series of still photographs of dead men, bloody body parts, bombed out cars, and captured weapons caches. It ends abruptly with a caption reading, \"if you want some come get some bitches.\" At the time I am writing this, the clip is available at http://www.liveleak.com/view?i=60fd7b9937. Another famous example is the use of photographs, once censored by the Pentagon, of rows of flag-wrapped caskets containing bodies of U.S. troops, loaded into C-130 aircraft returning to the military morgue in Dover, Delaware. It is not uncommon to find these images, taken by Americans working for the U.S. government in Iraq, in videos produced by anti-occupation groups from Iraq and the region. They are often deployed to address a potentially sympathetic audience of Americans who are angry with the Bush administration's denials about the real costs of war.The video clips are a kind of ephemera. They may appear one minute, be cut into various pieces, re-authored, circulated, and then even disappear. I'm faced with a dilemma posed to ethnographers working in field sites: it is impossible to conduct the same interviews again or to have identical field observations happen in different moments. But, moreover, with the cut and mix re-authoring availed by new digital technologies, the clips take on a palimpsestic quality, as you will experience in their moments of freezing, fading, and repeating. Each shifted iteration -- uploading, downloading, uploading again, streaming, etc. -- offers a a trace of a kind of re-authoring, only the author may be not a person but is likely to be a ghost or erratic code in the machine.One can easily predict that the kinds of footage included in this piece will become quotidian, if they haven't already for some of you who are reading this. But this project was undertaken at the beginning of a new chapter in the relationship between representation, media technologies, and violent conflict. I started it just as video sharing social networking sites were beginning to attract what have grown to be millions of viewers, many of whom are producers of media images themselves, though mostly having amateur skills levels. The advent of affordable video cameras, desk top editing software, high speed digital transmission vectors, and fascination with the homemade spectacle are elements that converge and take material form in the clips we've gathered.  Since the phenomenon of making, uploading, and circulating images in such a mass dimension is a new development, my commentary may seem elementary and simplistic in a few years or even a few months, once we have all grown accustomed to being around this kind of material in a daily way. I shudder to think how I may be getting things dead wrong in my readings of this material, just as some early commentators on photography and cinema seem to have been way off track in retrospect. But this emergent social matrix that brings together cameras, computers, bodies, weapons, sentiments, and ideas seems worthy of reflection, even if it is tentative and not yet very sophisticated. Who makes these clips and who watches them? From what I have been able to discern, based on thousands of hours of surveying internet video-sharing sites, watching hundreds of video clips, and reading all that is available on videography and the current wars, it appears that most of the uploaded material is produced by men and, though this is harder to verify, most of it is watched by other men. This seems to hold for video clips taken by U.S. forces and for clips gathered by groups opposed to U.S. occupation. Though more women than ever are enlisted among the U.S. ranks, they don't seem to be taking video footage or at least uploading any of it to video-sharing sites. A few women who are trained as specialists in military public affairs receive official credit for their videography on B-roll of operations, but it seems mostly to be men and mostly white men who are uploading combat videos to the internet. In fact, women are almost never featured in the clips. They seldom appear in the clips posted by Jihad-identified groups, but occasionally they are shown assembling IEDs, as you will see in one of the clips we've included here.What does this indicate? Simply put, it reflects the gender demographics of the U.S. military and of the anti-occupation groups, which are overwhelmingly comprised of men. But it may also indicate something about the relationship of gender to technology, especially videography, editing, uploading, and surfing the internet. It's not unheard of but it is rare to find video clips narrated by or featuring African American or Latino soldiers -- male or female -- even though there are significant percentages of these groups in the military. The ranks of the trained and amateur videographers vary, but mostly they seem to be enlisted men (not officers) gathering footage of combat in order to document operations or to have a kind of war journal in which they record their experiences of war to send home or to have as souvenirs to remember the time later. This situation may change with time but for now it is an interesting symptom to consider, especially since posting video clips to the internet is one way of offering a perspective on the war. It will be interesting to see if women soldiers or soldiers of color or immigrant soldiers trading military duty for citizenship start to upload their own videos to the internet. And if they do, it will be interesting to see if their footage draws on different codes of signification, different kinds of soundtrack and music, different framing techniques, and different perspectives on war.Here is a list of some of the video sharing websites which post U.S. military or anti-occupation videos:  http://www.militaryvideos.nethttp://www.military.comhttp://www.liveleak.comhttp://www.youtube.comhttp://www.infovlad.nethttp://www.atwar.nethttp://www.dvidshub.net (Digital video and Imagery Distribution System)http://www.assaultonterror.orghttp://www.khaibar.orghttp://www.albasrah.nethttp://www.militaryspot.comhttp://www.terroristmedia.comhttp://www.militarytimes.comhttp://www. iraqiwarvideos.nethttp://www.grouchymedia.comFor an interesting documentary film on the subject, see MTV Iraq Uploaded: The War Network TV Won't Show You, Shot By Soldiers and Posted Online, July 2006, discussed at http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1536780/20060720/index.jhtml and featured in excerpts at http://www.ifilm.comHere are a few examples of music-video style productions using photography or video clips from combat.

Jenny put an astounding quantity of time in researching the materials and writing the texts of this piece, and the result is in my opinion a true gift to the reader. The videos we included are ephemeral in nature, difficult to pinpoint in terms of source, location, time, and degree from original, and rarely subjected to any form of cultural, critical or formal analysis (though widely viewed and discussed in mainstream media venues and more 'private' collective networks). Hence the three frame horizontal format, an attempt to provide you with an opportunity to make your own critical observations, to begin to apprehend affectively, visually, and intellectually some of the motivations and decisions driving both the production and the dissemination of these pieces. Many of them are difficult to watch, and both Jenny and I suffered at times from a sort of post-traumatic malaise, triggered for me by the horror of the scenes unfolding before me, and more so by a kind of fractured empathy in relation to subject position”'I feel so totally for the rarely seen but heard 'shooter' and (generally his) company while experiencing sometimes total repulsion at their actions and, especially, reactions. It is difficult, no matter how many times I watch these, to imagine the complete alteration of body chemistry and perceptual framework being physically *at war* must produce.It was a great pleasure to work with Jenny and I encourage you to spend time with this piece. As you watch, keyframes trigger access to ideas, formal analysis, and contextual information. A sidenote, some of the keyframes that have been carefully programmed to trigger don't, and occasionally videos 'stick' midstream. We have tried to flag this when it happens, as you can generally drag the seek bar a tiny bit to the right and see more. These video data streams have been copied by many people many times over, and compressed in this case for this format, and at times the stream becomes so thin the player can no longer detect it.— Raegan Kelly","collection":"pièces"},{"id":"malperception","url":"http://vectorsjournal.org/projects/index.php?project=71","titre":"Malperception","personnes":"Perry Hoberman , Donald Hoffman","citation":"\\n\\t\\n\\tMalperception\\n\\t\\nBy Perry Hoberman & Donald Hoffman\\nEditor's Introduction'Close your eyes and imagine a color you have never seen before.\" This unanswerable challenge is a favorite of cognitive psychologist Donald Hoffman, as he seeks to reveal the limits of our perceptual apparatus.

We assume that vision is just like a camera, at each instant taking a picture of the world that shows it pretty much as it is. As long as we have two (or at least one) functioning eyes, we can simply open them up and see the world. However, in the case of many visual disorders, there turns out to be absolutely nothing wrong with the sufferer's eyes, and thus they can 'see\" as well as any of us. Instead, it is their ability to make sense of what they see that has become damaged or lost. The process of the eye's cornea focusing photons of light onto the rods and cones of the retina is, in fact, only the very first stage of visual perception.Remarkably, about half of the brain's cortex is engaged in vision: roughly fifty billion neurons and ten trillion synapses are engaged each time you open your eyes and glance around. If vision was really just like a camera, this computational power would be overkill. Research in the cognitive neurosciences has revealed that the visual system is more like a reality engine, constructing with astonishing quickness all the shapes, colors, objects, motions and depths that we see. Damage to this reality engine can profoundly impair our ability to construct the visual world, leading to a variety of bizarre visual deficits, ranging from an inability to recognize faces or see objects to various crippling failures to properly construct a three-dimensional world. Reflecting on the remarkable ways that the visual system can malfunction can give us insight into the actual nature of perception; each disorder shines a spotlight on some unexpected aspect of visual perception.In Malperception, the two of us - a cognitive science and an artist - joined forces in an attempt to visualize breakdowns in visual perception - a task that is inherently self-contradictory. Thus, it is probably inevitable that this project would be a mix of fact, speculation, and fiction. We chose a baker's dozen of visual disorders, and present each - through graphics, text and sound -  to encourage users to enter into the specific altered world experienced by a sufferer of this neurological condition. We hope that the experience of these worlds - in which nothing can be taken for granted - may ultimately cause users to question their own perceptions.— Perry Hoberman\\\\n\\n\\t\\n\\tMalperception\\n\\t\\nBy Perry Hoberman & Donald Hoffman\\nEditor's Introduction'Close your eyes and imagine a color you have never seen before.\" This unanswerable challenge is a favorite of cognitive psychologist Donald Hoffman, as he seeks to reveal the limits of our perceptual apparatus.

Reflecting on the remarkable ways that the visual system can malfunction can give us insight into the actual nature of perception; each disorder shines a spotlight on some unexpected aspect of visual perception.In Malperception, the two of us - a cognitive science and an artist - joined forces in an attempt to visualize breakdowns in visual perception - a task that is inherently self-contradictory. Thus, it is probably inevitable that this project would be a mix of fact, speculation, and fiction. We chose a baker's dozen of visual disorders, and present each - through graphics, text and sound -  to encourage users to enter into the specific altered world experienced by a sufferer of this neurological condition. We hope that the experience of these worlds - in which nothing can be taken for granted - may ultimately cause users to question their own perceptions.— Perry Hoberman\\\\n\\n\\t\\n\\tMalperception\\n\\t\\nBy Perry Hoberman & Donald Hoffman\\nEditor's Introduction'Close your eyes and imagine a color you have never seen before.\" This unanswerable challenge is a favorite of cognitive psychologist Donald Hoffman, as he seeks to reveal the limits of our perceptual apparatus. The conjunction of brain and sense organs is not, he argues, a matter of merely receiving information about the world around us and translating it into understandable information. Rather, our brains function as a kind of \"reality engine,\" which allows us to construct the world according to perceptual conventions that sometimes directly contradict what our conscious minds know is true. This gap between what we \"see\" and what we know provides an extraordinarily fertile zone for experimentation, with implications that reach far beyond our ability to correctly identify colors to a zone of epistemological contention that includes cultural and historical meaning as well. But these are questions that the average scientist is often reluctant if not ill-equipped to address. Hoffman's collaboration with media Artist Perry Hoberman allows for an exploration of the intersection of perception and cognition that is at once playful and serious, exceeding the conventional boundaries of both clinical and artistic practice. To explore this intersection, Hoberman and Hoffman posit a series of aberrant conditions that reveal the inner workings of the brain. While much of western culture continues to labor under the burden of rationalism and positivism -- fancy terms for outworn cliches such as \"seeing is believing\" -- the representational capacity of images, sounds and words seems to let us down at every turn. To what degree do factors such as expectation, enculturation and narrative inflect our most basic understanding of the world around us? Hoberman and Hoffman have each been pursuing these questions within their discrete fields of interactive art and cognitive science respectively for decades. Through their collaboration, the Malperception project affords the opportunity to examine both issues of perception and cognition and a provocative experiment at the intersection of art and science.— Vectors Journal Editorial Staff","collection":"pièces"},{"id":"mobile-figures","url":"http://vectorsjournal.org/projects/index.php?project=54","titre":"Mobile Figures","personnes":"David Lloyd","citation":"\\n\\t\\n\\tMobile Figures\\n\\t\\nBy David Lloyd\\nDesign by Erik LoyerEditor's IntroductionIf 'mobility' seems very much a buzz word of the new millennium, packaged and sold to us via an ever-increasing array of sleek and shiny devices, 'Mobile Figures' insists we think the term historically and culturally by routing us back to an earlier place and time.

Possibly no population in the nineteenth century was more mobile than the poor Irish who, even before the disastrous Famine of 1845-1851, were given to seasonal and sometimes permanent migration to Britain and further afield, in search of work to see them through the months when the potato crop was exhausted or as a population displaced by agricultural rationalization.  Their mobility was disturbing to English observers for several reasons.  In the first place the \"contagious example\" of their modes of life was seen as threatening to infect and corrupt the manners of the English working class, lowering their living standards and expectations as well as their rates of wages.   The migrant Irish were also assumed literally to bear with them disease and contagion, their dunghills being held to be the source of the \"miasmas\" from which pestilence was supposed to arise.The Irish also present, however, a source of discursive disturbance.  For political economy, they are a theoretical anomaly, surviving in excessive numbers on a subsistence crop whose abundance defies the laws of economics and supports a laboring population far in excess of the available capital.  More than that, they trouble the very axes of language itself.  The recurrent figures of Irishness—the potato, dung and miasma—are metaphors that are simultaneously metonyms, identities that fix them yet that are modes of displacement.  The Irish as peasants are like potatoes off which they live, by which they live:  stolid, lumpish, confined to the local, yet like the potato they spread and proliferate wildly in a rhizomatic process of reproduction—in a metonymic movement.   Like the dung in contiguity with which they live, they are a waste, redundant matter, but one also which oozes and flows to contaminate whatever it touches.  They move, contagiously, like the miasmas that emanate from them.  In this perpetual shift between metaphor and metonym, the Irish become the mimics of the system of exchange itself, in which commodities occupy simultaneously the axes of likeness and of substitution.  Caught in the dispossessing displacements of primitive accumulation, and thrown on the labour market as that ultimate commodity, abstract labour, the mobile Irish who seem so peripheral and backward in relation to capitalism, become the parodic double of its own vertiginous and destabilizing flows.\"Mobile Figures\" seeks not only to present an account of Irish mobility in the nineteenth century, but to enact that mobility and its effects.  Structured around the three tropes of Irishness, potato, dung and miasma, the text constructs a rhizomatic network of movements between nodes of argument, archival material and amplifying commentary.  These nodes are linked at once metonymically, in the sense that a set of syntagms or threads link steps in the argument to one another, and metaphorically, in that the citations construct a web of paradigmatic statements, both about the Irish and about the figures that inscribe them in a network of associations.  Although the text can be read as a series of propositions organized within a linear argument and supported by evidentiary material, it can also be read as a potentially inexhaustible fabric of associative threads, each node of which branches into other sets of association.  Such a text seeks to use the possibilities of web publication to enact the processes that a standard print-medium essay would only describe.  It is consequently necessarily experimental and open-ended, doubtful as it is that an exhaustive set of associations could be established.  Ideally, indeed, this is a text that would invite supplementation, the reader being invited to add citations and commentary that would extend the schematic net of associations established here, no restriction on legitimate and illegitimate associations being in principle possible, and each node opening onto fields that surely exceed the purview of any single \"author\".— David Lloyd\\\\n\\n\\t\\n\\tMobile Figures\\n\\t\\nBy David Lloyd\\nDesign by Erik LoyerDesigner's StatementFrom the outset it was clear that David Lloyd, self-described 'technopeasant,\" had been ready for quite some time to write through a database.  One of the joys of this project was working to create an environment that would accommodate his almost gleeful willingness to remake his scholarly work using the tools of interactive media.  Interactive projects like this one, whose content begins life in another medium, are inevitably about \"slice and dice,\" or how to chop up the content into atomic chunks that can be tagged, sorted and categorized.  This must be done so that the computer can have some \"understanding\" of the content and thus react intelligently when the user interacts with that content.   The process is often accompanied by an understandable fear on the part of the author.  Not in David's case, however, and for this I'm grateful, not just because his adventurousness made our collaboration easier, but also because it allowed me to focus on the more constructive aspects of the design.  In other words: now that we've atomized the content, how do we put it back together?Quite early on we decided that the database design would lead everything else, and after a few initial meetings, the structure of the piece's content as a collection of annotated nodes and threads started to suggest itself.  Very quickly, and with minimal visual exploration having been done, we had the database up and running, along with a set of entry tools created by Craig Dietrich, to whom both David and I are heavily indebted. At this point, David was able to begin entering his content directly into the database, while I developed the functionality and look of the piece simultaneously.  It was a tremendously liberating, if somewhat frightening, way to work.  Allowing for maximum flexibility, the database was intentionally loaded with more structures than we would be likely to use, and those structures could be fruitfully interpreted in multiple ways by the program I was writing. Often David and I would wind up in extended e-mail discussions about the particulars of how this or that piece of data should be entered by him and acted upon by the piece.  At times it felt as if we were swimming through endless layers of abstraction, looking for resonances even down to the level of the meaning of individual words—anything that would be a useful foundation upon which to build our lattice of content.This process of construction was for me the most enjoyable and fruitful part of the project, because it was fundamentally about revealing aspects of David's work that might previously have remained buried, owing to the demands of linearity.  This unearthing of process as well as of content was, I think, mutually encouraging: at the end of one meeting David mentioned that he eventually wanted to use the database to write poetry.

These keywords can then be browsed for the trajectories they carve through the text, and the thread of a particular keyword traced to reveal a skeletal narrative that can be embellished with the comments of users.  Our aim is an instantiation of a 'collaborative complex ecology\" between narrative and database of the type Hayles describes, and a forum where the fluidity of dialogue she seeks can be explored.

Along the way, they accrue a multiplicity of meanings and provide glimpses into complex circuits of labor, ideology and imagination. Erik Loyer's interface for the project is deceptively simple, mobilizing a playful metaphor for the weaving process itself, as users are invited to make connections between nodes of information, artifacts and analysis by stretching a string across the surface of an image. Moallem's analysis is dense with allusion and a multiplicity of voices that create a rich (dare I say?) tapestry of perspectives, analytical paradigms and potential axes of investigation. Among the most powerful elements of this far-reaching exploration are the author's own ethnographic research materials, which remind us of the labor and lived experience of the women who actually make the carpets. Their stories and experiences are rendered through  images, conversations and testimonies that ground the analysis of  broader circuits of distribution and consumption. Nation on the Move is also one of the first Vectors projects to deploy an alternative indexing system which makes the project's full contents available via an interface, generated dynamically from the database of materials feeding the project. The visualization engine used for this parallel interface reveals the categories and connections used to map the materials feeding Loyer's interface, but significantly, each item in the database is assigned a discrete URL to facilitate citation, indexing and accessibility. Although the primary Vectors interface remains the richest and most stimulating means of experiencing Moallem's work, we hope that making each element of her research and analysis available externally will help the project find a broader audience and suggest possibilities for extending her investigation even further.— Vectors Journal Editorial Staff\\\\n\\n\\t\\n\\tNation on the Move\\n\\t\\nBy Minoo Moallem\\nDesign by Erik LoyerAuthor's StatementIn this essay, I focus on the Persian carpet as a borderline object between art, craft, and commodity. I interrogate the politics of demand and desire that derive from the modern notions and imaginaries of home and homeland as well as consumer pleasures arising from the conveniences and commodiousness of a repetitious consumer activity. The Nation-on the-Move involves a multidimensional, multilocational, and polyvocal approach by way of digital technologies. It recognizes the unevenness of time (time of production, advertisement, online auctions, and consumption); the mingling of the old, the new, and the emergent; spatial proximity or distance (here, there, and elsewhere); and the relation of nonvalue to use value and exchange value in a 'scopic economy\" that subsidizes the flow of representations for the history of material objects by producing audiences/spectators with a scattered and disconnected sense of attention. To challenge the shattering effects of consumerism, the designer and programmer, Erik Loyer has created what could be similar to a panel-design carpet that brings into the same frame of reference different times, spaces, and locations—real, fictional, and virtual—including ethnographic photography, TV auctions, movies, Orientalist painting, advertisement, museums, and art galleries.Erik's design enables the reader/audience to take part in an embodied mode of interaction, weaving together different and fragmented worlds of images and meanings while interacting with the project. A number of threads are available and each thread has a color which corresponds to one of the ten main themes that are running through all the panels, linking what seems to be disconnected. Each panel has a number of sites and each site has different content that is linked through the colored threads. The embodied interaction with the project surpasses the centrality of sight and involves other senses including hearing and touching, along with the aesthetic and affective pleasures of visual maps, moving diagrams, and geometric shapes. The white thread functions as a wrap or a tar, which includes the threads stretched between the two sides of the loom. The colored threads are functioning as the weft or pood, which runs through the threads that are located between one line of knots and the next. Its function is to keep the knots in parallel lines and to firm up the fabric of the carpet. In this case, the weft is keeping the thread for the geometrical shapes with the text (the circles and squares containing the text). The text and the design are nonlinear, leaving gaps open for what yet can come into the writing/view/perception.This project is part of a book-length manuscript. I began to think about this project when I started to question the limits of feminist politics as it relates to the politics of value and choice. The speed in which the connection between political oppression and economic exploitation is abandoned for the seductive and consumerist purpose of whatever gains an exchange value in the political discourse is striking if not disturbing. An interrogation of the convergence of militarism, surveillance, and consumptive production through gender, sexual, and national tropes in everyday life and the disconnection of bodies destroyed by war or overexploitation from those making choices in their performance of who they choose to be, what frames of identity to belong to, and what to consume on a daily basis has been crucial in working on this project. There is an urgent need for an understanding of the linkages between the current global feminization of labor and questions of political oppression and the politics of value. While we are living in an age of cultural interference and hybridity of ideas, values, and aesthetic sensibilities, our present condition does not break with modern ways of thinking conspicuously influenced by cultures of colonialism and postcolonial forms of otherness. Indeed, civilizational thinking has gained new purchase in our current context investing in the notions of identity and difference as absolute entities in constant conflict and antagonism with each other. In this process, gender and sexuality have been the defining components of such thinking as they converge with the representation of goods and commodities in modernity and postmodernity in bordering and marking identities.In this work, I reformulate and rethink a number of issues in a radically different fashion. Firstly, I problematize the separation of arts, crafts, and commodities in modernist regimes of differentiation as they participate in the separation of politics from the realms of culture and economy. Secondly, I question the discourses of gender, sexuality, race, nation, and empire in the production of identity and difference in commodity culture and consumerism. Thirdly, I elaborate on the importance of what I call the scopic economy in looking at the intersection of visuality, consumerism, and identity. Fourthly, I examine the politics of mediation in the transnational, translational and transactional moment of exchange. Some of my general questions include: What are the new aesthetic forms of citizenship that are articulated through notions of identity and difference in a transnational world? How are they defined by transnational alliances of art, media, advertisements, and the circulation of commodities? How are they articulated through notions of gender, sexuality, race, and nation? In which ways do they participate in making the nation compatible with the empire by means of a scopic economy?This project challenges modes of explanations within which \"the primitive,\" \"the tribal,\" and \"the female subject\" are brought into the scopic economy to be dismissed as \"the other\" of civilization. It rather shows to what extent modern forms of subjection rely on the power of the subject (or the effects of the power in the body) that they try to control. An analysis of commodity culture and the implicit and explicit connections between the formation and transformation of gender and sexuality, the male gaze, and the representation of difference in the oculocentric culture of modernity is crucial for our understanding of the recurrent visual display of a number of tropes, including \"the woman on the carpet\" or \"the Oriental tribal woman at the loom,\" as they exhibit the desire for a feminized \"home/homeland\" in its distinction from the \"market/diaspora.\"This project is not aimed at resolving inequalities or taking the seductive position of the modernist avant-garde (artist/scholar) to advocate for the oppressed and the exploited. This is not a counterculture effort but a manner of thinking via digital technologies about how commodities came to be the way they are, how identities are assembled through consumption, and how the \"I\" of the subject gets inserted into this process. As a result of collaborative work with the designer and the employment of digital technology, this project aspires to resist logocentric notions of communicative action as well as the consumerist recounting of suffering as it takes pleasure in consuming pain. It also moves with and against the \"I\" as the sovereign self of the consumer and sight as the ocular location from which a commodity is targeted by experimenting with the critical effects of what is the result of a collaborative undertaking between Erik and me which required a decentered scholarly mediation to allow the carpet to speak to an audience which is evoked to interact with the interface via a mimetic identification with the weaver through the mediation of the computer designer and programmer.Minoo Moallem— Minoo Moallem\\\\n\\n\\t\\n\\tNation on the Move\\n\\t\\nBy Minoo Moallem\\nDesign by Erik LoyerDesigner's StatementInterfaces are often marketed as filters that help to distinguish signal from noise in an information-saturated environment.  They enable us, we are told, to reveal messages that would have otherwise been hidden in clutter; they allow us to make information more appealing by removing traces of the things which disinterest us.In Nation on the Move, our goal was the opposite: instead of rendering complicated things simple, Minoo Moallem and I wanted to trouble simplicity with disorder. Over the course of the piece, a single thread is pulled, teased and stretched into a chaotic web of interconnections between ideas of nationhood, gender, commerce and art that comprise the world of the Persian carpet. At the heart of the work is an acknowledgment of the essential impossibility of 'sorting out\" these relationships into some well-defined hierarchy. Paradoxically, this rhetorical strategy is the result of careful interpretation of the extreme orderliness of the database which drives the project.  This database is comprised of \"panels\" defining each image and video clip the user sees. Each panel contains active locations called \"sites\" at which one or more pieces of content may live. Each piece of content is then assigned a thematic \"thread\" which ends up being rendered as a literal thread in the visual presentation. As the user progressively reveals the content of the piece, these threads become more and more jumbled.The chaotic trajectories of the threads arise from two factors. The first is that our foundation visual element is the image, which we treat as a 2D landscape containing short texts at specific locations suggested by the image content.  Since the individual images have no relationship to each other in their composition, the texts end up being laid out in a fashion which appears almost random. The second factor is the visual persistence of the threads, which are constrained to pass through the location of each bit of content to which they are linked. The combination of these elements ensures that once the user has explored a majority of the images she will be faced with a tangle of threads anchored by content which seems to be laid out at random.The seeming chaos of the piece is thus quite designed, as it often is in the digital realm. Unlike the physics of disarray we're accustomed to encountering in the physical world, in the digital world content creators are frequently cast in the role of entropic agents, adding measured amounts of chaos in an attempt to hit the \"sweet spots\" of human perception. To see a visual representation of the order which the project transmutes into chaos, take a look at the project's interactive index, an experiment in making the underlying structure of Vectors projects more accessible to the general public. The index is a graphical browser of the Nation on the Move database in which individual elements can be bookmarked for review or citation purposes.

Amelie Hastie used her object, the movie ticket stub, to describe her concept for Objects of Media Studies. She took me to the theater, esconced me in the dark, invited me to partake of the wonderful and fleeting pleasures particular to moviegoing--the light, the hush, the sense of wholeness, loss and discovery.Our initial impetus was to inscribe the objects in the final collection, rendering them shot through with connection--to each other, to the personal, political, historical, social, economic, and cultural. Each object would be experienced as both screen and projection.The seminar itself exploded that approach; over time, the group readings, conversations, thought and scrutiny engendered a conceptual space that for me was the object of the Objects of Media Studies project. From within this collective conceptual space emerged themes of dust, screens, and exchange (specifically, the swap meet). Also guiding me: the tactile qualities of memory, desire and poignancy; re-animation; context; the prolonged collaboration between makers and viewers intrinsic to moving media.+The structure of Objects of Media Studies seeks to preserve author and object not as singularities but as the products of collective thought and action.I turned to two texts wherein the act of reading is also an act of writing: Sven Lindqvist's A History of Bombing and Walter Benjamin's Arcades Project. A diagram* I concocted of Lindqvist's book, a story of the 20th century in which 22 themes are broken into 399 sections and presented chronologically, is a diagram of the modes of reading afforded by Lindqvist's structural approach. You can read the book first page to last or you can follow the 22 themes, moving along a series of interlocking ellipses by reading forward then jumping back in the book to the next theme. The structure enacts the dovetailing of the personal and political described in his text. By puncturing the text's assumed linearity, a series of openings, accidents, and opportunities are presented the reader. (*not an exact representation of the sequencing of original text)Visual depictions of Benjamin's Arcades resemble the space of the arcade, long punctuated galleries linked through theme, reference and sequence.                               [The Collector]                [Dolls]:::[H1,1]                              [H1,2]  [H1a, 1]::::[Mirrors]                               [H1,3]  [H1a, 2]                              [H1,4]  [H1a, 3]                              [H1,5]  [H1a, 4][Diorama]::::::::::::[H1,6]  [H1a, 5]Benjamin's histories, accounts, sights, sounds, smells, references, and allegories recreate the space of the Arcades and its contents, a recollection screened through overlapping thematic filters.In both Lindqvist and Benjamin the structure tends to collapse hierarchies between personal and 'official' history, and between citation and 'original' writing.++Wishing to acknowledge the aptness of the swap meet metaphor in the fabric of the design, I conceived of an interface that allowed the reader to 'wander' at will between the text segments and images of the eight object narratives using three columns of shifting content. Amelie, already implementing new structural approaches in her own writing, took on the immense task of piecing eight disparate voices into one coherent collective story with seven thematic access points.

Amelie Hastie used her object, the movie ticket stub, to describe her concept for Objects of Media Studies. She took me to the theater, esconced me in the dark, invited me to partake of the wonderful and fleeting pleasures particular to moviegoing--the light, the hush, the sense of wholeness, loss and discovery.Our initial impetus was to inscribe the objects in the final collection, rendering them shot through with connection--to each other, to the personal, political, historical, social, economic, and cultural. Each object would be experienced as both screen and projection.The seminar itself exploded that approach; over time, the group readings, conversations, thought and scrutiny engendered a conceptual space that for me was the object of the Objects of Media Studies project. From within this collective conceptual space emerged themes of dust, screens, and exchange (specifically, the swap meet). Also guiding me: the tactile qualities of memory, desire and poignancy; re-animation; context; the prolonged collaboration between makers and viewers intrinsic to moving media.+The structure of Objects of Media Studies seeks to preserve author and object not as singularities but as the products of collective thought and action.I turned to two texts wherein the act of reading is also an act of writing: Sven Lindqvist's A History of Bombing and Walter Benjamin's Arcades Project. A diagram* I concocted of Lindqvist's book, a story of the 20th century in which 22 themes are broken into 399 sections and presented chronologically, is a diagram of the modes of reading afforded by Lindqvist's structural approach. You can read the book first page to last or you can follow the 22 themes, moving along a series of interlocking ellipses by reading forward then jumping back in the book to the next theme. The structure enacts the dovetailing of the personal and political described in his text. By puncturing the text's assumed linearity, a series of openings, accidents, and opportunities are presented the reader. (*not an exact representation of the sequencing of original text)Visual depictions of Benjamin's Arcades resemble the space of the arcade, long punctuated galleries linked through theme, reference and sequence.                               [The Collector]                [Dolls]:::[H1,1]                              [H1,2]  [H1a, 1]::::[Mirrors]                               [H1,3]  [H1a, 2]                              [H1,4]  [H1a, 3]                              [H1,5]  [H1a, 4][Diorama]::::::::::::[H1,6]  [H1a, 5]Benjamin's histories, accounts, sights, sounds, smells, references, and allegories recreate the space of the Arcades and its contents, a recollection screened through overlapping thematic filters.In both Lindqvist and Benjamin the structure tends to collapse hierarchies between personal and 'official' history, and between citation and 'original' writing.++Wishing to acknowledge the aptness of the swap meet metaphor in the fabric of the design, I conceived of an interface that allowed the reader to 'wander' at will between the text segments and images of the eight object narratives using three columns of shifting content. Amelie, already implementing new structural approaches in her own writing, took on the immense task of piecing eight disparate voices into one coherent collective story with seven thematic access points. Together we devised a sequencing logic that interweaves the object narratives 'vertically' into her 'horizontal' collective narrative.For the images we selected a set of cinematic tropes: zoom, fade, pan, tilt, dissolve, reveal. This second order access encourages exploration and interrupts reading rhythm by at times obliterating or dominating the interface.+++A promise of interactivity, to violate the author and promote the reader, seats you and me at the same table.

The San Francisco-based Prelinger, who has been collecting advertising, educational and industrial films for more than two decades, in 2002 sold his collection of over 50,000 films to the Library of Congress. He has since turned his energies to advocating a renewed conception of archival practice that involves actively pushing works out into the public, rather than simply storing them passively.In 2005, Prelinger completed a feature film titled Panorama Ephemera, a meditative chronicle remarkably free of the camp humor of many ephemeral remixes. The images and sounds presented in Prelinger's film are treated with meticulous respect for their materiality and status as signifying objects. Each shot or sequence in the film forms part of a \"cognitive map\" of American history, revealing patterns of obsession that orbit around such mundane but foundational themes as growing food, Westward migration, the transformation of landscape, and the development of democracy, as well as relationships among animals, humans, nature and civilization. The online version of Panorama Ephemera, created in collaboration with Vectors Art Director Raegan Kelly, is similarly devoted to preserving the integrity of individual media elements, while interweaving them with Prelinger's own personal and professional trajectories, milestones and musings. Perhaps most interesting is the opportunity this project provides to explore Prelinger's personal history via the artifacts by which his career has been defined. In foregrounding Prelinger's personal history as a lens through which to view the films, Panorama Ephemera models a form of historiography, that underscores the inevitability of authorial intervention in the process of assembling a historical narrative.— Vectors Journal Editorial Staff\\\\n\\n\\t\\n\\tPanorama Ephemera\\n\\t\\nBy Rick Prelinger\\nDesign by Raegan KellyAuthor's StatementIn 2004 I tucked twenty years of thinking about moving image archives into the back of my mind and resolved to make a film.  Most archivists consider doing this at one time or another, but archival work and production are two very different kinds of activities.  It's hard to turn off a sense of 'archivalness,\" to let go one's concern for archival practice, and dismiss the feeling that archivists and art makers are somehow wired differently.  Plus, the constraints of time and money often render film production an exercise in achieving the impossible, and archivists tend to live well within the domain of possible.As if to prove others wrong, I spent several months pulling videotapes off the shelf and very slowly watching footage I'd always wanted to view.  I began with a rough outline of what I wanted to assemble, but the details, and of course the specific images I wanted to use, remained unclear. Since most of my viewing has always been directed toward finding specific images, I tend to watch almost everything in fast forward, and it was a delight to stroll through the collection and linger on interesting items, capturing them to disc and watching them repeatedly.  In a short time I drifted into a kind of cinephilia, taking culinary pleasure in the images I was finding and poring over, and celebrating a kind of anti-intellectual attitude toward the material.  After years of focusing on the context of the films -- Who made them and why?  For what purpose was money spent to produce an expensive public statement?  Out of whose ideas did this film come from?  And how was it received, and what effect? -- I put all context aside and pretended the images were nothing more than just images.  \"An egg is just an egg,\" I told myself.This is, of course, a mental scam, but it's probably necessary to get work done.  And after awhile I convinced myself that it was a conceit that might help me get beyond some real snags that make working with archival footage really difficult.  What if, I thought, I regarded these ideology-laden and rhetorically rich films as a kind of simple evidence (an oversimplification), as documentary images of ideas and trends (fine, if you can accept tendentious images as documentation), stripped them of their context (though you can never really do that) and assembled them into my own synthesis of the past 250 years of North Aerican history and culture?  I hoped to redirect these film segments from being objects of discussion towards being the building-blocks of drama, and see what might happen.Another vexing issue made the archival clips very difficult to work with.  One of the most alluring aspects of old advertising, educational, government and industrial films is their style -- the impossibly bright, saturated colors of Kodachrome; the stentorian, sure voices of their narrators; the forgettable music that triggers diffuse, unclear emotions; their mobilization of imaginary, abundant space inside now-demolished studios to enable ideology to flourish.  For years I reveled in the appreciation of the style and surrealism of these films, cataloging their representational quirks and strategies as I explored the alternative universe of what is paradoxically called \"factual film.\"  But now I questioned this way of looking and listening.  It seemed to obstruct my \"egg is just an egg\" perspective.  Style began to look like baggage weighing down these clips, dragging them into a less interesting domain.  I didn't want to get hung up on the tone of a narrator's voice or on the rounded body of a 1950s car.  I wanted to point people to what each clip was actually showing or saying.  Just that.For awhile I thought that style was so hard to ignore, so hard to strip from the footage, that I couldn't make an archival film.  Even if I could, it seemed as if I was going to ask my audience to ignore or reject much of what they found pleasurable about looking at archival stuff.  This might be too much to ask, or it might be boring.  But then \"Panorama Ephemera\" emerged, was screened as a work in progress, got reworked for another few months, and started to show around.Introducing it at screenings and festivals, I found that people tended to ask the same questions.  Here and there, people asked about the film.  Perhaps more often, they wanted to know about archives, questions about archival access, control over the raw materials of history, and intellectual \"property.\"  As an archivist, I was expected to make a meta-archival film, something about \"archivalness.\"  I hadn't wanted to do that.And then a Vectors residency and collaboration with Raegan Kelly offered a chance to turn Panorama inside out and use its structure as the spine for a discursion on archives and access to culture.  As it turned out, I already knew much of what I wanted to say, because I'd said it before.  So, similar to a compilation film made of preexisting materials, the Vectors' piece combines preexisting texts (and some new ones) with a chronology, a glossary, and a sequence-by-sequence version of the film, all linked through a matrix of associations.  Though it may be read in any number of ways, the network of associations is its heart.  The piece stands as evidence that there is nothing about a film or any work of art that cannot be turned inside out or upside down and redeployed for purposes that diverge from those of the original work.  It also challenges artists to think as archivists and open-content activists do, and archivists to think more like artists.The Vectors' piece was not a simple endeavor, and text plus film clips plus associations don't structure themselves.  Though I had a high degree of freedom to plan, execute, succeed or fail, everything in the piece is present and functional because Raegan K. found a way to make it so.  Although she is formally credited as designer, the design and strategy of the piece is integral to its clarity and function, and it would be misleading to think of her role as circumscribed by legacy definitions of what a designer does and doesn't do.

This provocative question forms the foundation of Jane McGonigal's PlaceStorming, which begins with the seemingly dubious union of academic writing and pervasive, mobile gaming. Not only does the game put the 'site\" back into \"cite,\" but it perforates the walls dividing academia and the world at large, inviting academicians to relinquish the sanctity of their written texts and gamers to play with those texts, transforming their meaning through an unlikely process of disassembly, recombination and discovery. McGonigal's work poses perhaps the most challenging reconfiguration of scholarly practice contained in this issue of Vectors, but it is not to be dismissed out of hand. Those who are involved in game studies have been fighting an uphill battle for legitimacy during the past decade or so of this nascent field's development. Most have attempted to position games on a safe continuum with related forms such as cinema, literature or performance, laboring to retool the conceptual frameworks from those fields to bring insight to the structural, narrative and social dimensions of gaming. McGonigal's approach differs in that it insists on being both formally and conceptually innovative; suggesting that, indeed, the theorization of emergent gaming practices is most productively enacted through a \"playful\" mode of engagement as well as a serious one. McGonigal dares her users to dismiss this method, which takes literally academia's often-stated but seldom-realized goals of collaboration and relevance outside the walls of the university. For those who are willing to traverse these familiar boundaries, PlaceStorming serves as a reminder that spaces are also places and that abstract coordinates are rooted in physical locations, which are both culturally diverse and geographically specific. Ultimately, McGonigal's argument offers a convincing counterpoint to conventional wisdom regarding mobile and pervasive technologies, which would have us believe in the spatially dislocated nature of life in an increasingly mobilized world.— Vectors Journal Editorial Staff\\\\n\\n\\t\\n\\tPlaceStorming\\n\\tv. 3.0\\n\\t\\nBy Jane McGonigal\\nDesign by Raegan KellyAuthor's StatementPlaceStorming v. 3.0 asks you to trust a cut-up, the Dadaist practice of playfully re-arranging and juxtaposing texts to uncover hidden meanings, to speak for your research.

But Wendy Chun and Reagan Kelly want us to think the archive differently.  As with several other projects in this issue of Vectors, the piece urges you to shift your line of vision and to think about the larger stakes our frenzy of digitization might likely conceal. The piece begins by locating race as an archive and also as a potential origin for all archives, \"as justifying the desire for an order and an origin.\"  As the user begins to navigate, traditional expectations of the cursor's effect are frustrated and denied.  Text shifts and emerges via an internal logic that confounds our epistemophilic desires.

Race permeates this archive, even as the archive refuses to unfold for us, underscoring the strange mutability of race as at once origin and effect.  The structure of \"Programmed Visions\" reminds us, as does an excerpt from Ann Laura Stoler within the archive, that race and racism \"take on the form of other things.\"  In the interplay between \"form\" and \"content,\" we are meant to understand that our desires to standardize the world and make it interoperable are not innocent.  Such desires inform today's coding practices and information architectures, but they also permeated eugenics in the early 20th century, if in slightly different forms.

Expensively kept, economically unsound, a spurious and useless political asset in election campaigns, racism is as healthy today as it was during the Enlightenment.  It seems that it has a utility far beyond economy, beyond the sequestering of classes from one another, and has assumed a metaphorical life so completely embedded in daily discourse that it is perhaps more necessary and more on display than ever before.\"--Toni MorrisonThis project grapples with the paradox Toni Morrison so eloquently articulates: the discrediting of race as a biological category has not led to the end of race or raced images, but rather to their proliferation.  To explain this phenomenon, it examines what work \"knowing race\" does--how the drive to \"know race\" is intertwined with the very truth mechanisms of visual media and technologies, the logic of genetics, and the banal everyday actions of our governments.  Building an archive of diverse texts (from early 20th century American eugenics textbooks to Toni Morrison's _The Bluest Eye_, from late 19th century British texts on fingerprinting to the UNESCO statements on race), it argues that what is important about controversies over the meaning of race is not: is race biological or cultural, as if the terms \"biological\" or \"cultural\" were themselves static.  More importantly, the  terms \"biological\" and \"cultural\" rely on race for their very meaning, for modern racial discourses define and negotiate the relationship between the social, the scientific, the legal and the cultural.  Dissension over the nature of race does not defuse the importance of race, but rather bears testimony to the work race does.\"Programmed Visions\" stems from a larger book project of the same title that traces the surprising resonances between software and race as forms (or alleged forms) of archival knowledge.  This book investigates race and software as visualizations of supposedly transmissible, trackable, yet invisible technological, biological or cultural sources--software, dna, race as ahistorical programmed histories.  Race in science, for instance, has not disappeared but is now re-surging in molecular biology as mutations in mostly unexpressed genetic material, as a way to establish ancestry—linear, forensic relation.  This project wagers that that race and software maintain visual knowledge in an age of waning indexicality--they precipitate what I call a frenzy of and a decline in visual knowledge.  Thus in content and in form, \"Programmed Visions\" plays with the idea: the less we know--the less we are certain of--the more we are shown in an attempt to wed the visual into a causal relationship with the invisible.  Rather than simply being a visualization of a theoretical argument, this project seeks to trouble the relationship between visualization and theory, and a major goal of this project is to interrogate the visual and mathematical metaphors that dominate Michel Foucault's work on archives.The final form of this project stems from many weekly conversations between Raegan Kelly and myself.  Working from the texts, we gradually developed a structure--a complex volume--which we felt began to address the concept \"race as archive.\"  Playing with the structure, we wanted to make clear the resonances between the technical aspects of this project (database, code etc.) and its content: race as a form of programmability.— Wendy Hui Kyong Chun\\\\n\\n\\t\\n\\tProgrammed Visions\\n\\t\\nBy Wendy Hui Kyong Chun\\nDesign by Raegan KellyDesigner's StatementOne of the many threads running through Wendy's work entails a critical examination of practices of reduction and simplification at the surface that in the end can become (have become?) a kind of mechanistic truth.

Access to and through this surface would only be achieved through prolonged physical engagement.  In the end, we honed structurally closer to Foucault's contextual archival volume and added 'depth' (implied by transparency) to the interface.

Less obvious from the confines of the freeway is another rapidly expanding industry within the region, the state's massive prison system.  As Sharon Daniel narrates in the voice over that opens this project, a thirty square mile area near Chowchilla houses three prisons, including the two largest women's prisons in the world.  Public Secrets reconfigures the physical, psychological, and ideological spaces of the prison, allowing us to learn about life inside the prison along several thematic pathways and from multiple points of view.  Through a thoughtful and respectful framing and layering of the voices of individual women, we get a view from inside but also a view in context.      Moving through the many voices brought together here, you are asked to listen with care to new points of view and to examine prisons from the inside out.  The piece seeks to dispel popular misconceptions about the nature of prisons and those incarcerated within them, offering compelling evidence of the violence and abuse that such systems perpetuate by their very nature.  As Jane Dorotik observes within the piece, 'It is a story I knew nothing about until I was sent here.\"  While much of the piece highlights the voices and experiences of individual women, the networked structure of the project and the women themselves insist that we understand the prison industrial complex as a social problem that impacts us all, its dehumanizing effects spiraling out to call into question the basic principles underpinning any just and democratic society.  Public Secrets asks us each to realize that the prison system diminishes us all.      The very design of the project -- its algorithmic structure -- calls our attention to the shifting borders between inside and outside, incarceration and freedom, oppression and resistance, despair and hope.  Throughout your navigation of the piece, the fine lines demarcating such binaries will morph, shift, and reconfigure, calling any easy assumptions about 'us' and 'them' into question.  Rather, inside and outside mutually determine and construct one another, sketching powerful vectors of relation between individual experiences and broader social systems.From the very first design meetings in support of this piece, Sharon Daniel has consistently described her work with incarcerated women as an abolitionist project; that is, Public Secrets is part of a larger resistance movement that aims to dismantle the prison system in pursuit of a more humane world.  As the activist organization with which Daniel works, Justice Now, announces on its website, \"we believe in working toward a society that no longer relies on prisons but instead invests resources in making communities stronger.\"  It is hard to come away from a sustained engagement with this project and not be moved toward that goal, undergoing a kind of conversion experience that profoundly re-jiggers one's perception.                   What function does the three million dollar razor wire fence at the California Correctional Women's Facility serve?  Certainly, it keeps people 'in' the prison, but perhaps, more crucially, it gives society an easy 'out,' functioning as a convenient screen for our disavowals about systemic injustice, social inequality, and the crippling effects of poverty.  \"Public Secrets\" powerfully reveals the costs -- both personal and social -- of such projections and denials.— Vectors Journal Editorial Staff\\\\n\\n\\t\\n\\tPublic Secrets\\n\\t\\nBy Sharon Daniel\\nDesign by Erik LoyerAuthor's Statement'Truth is not a matter of exposure which destroys the secret, but a revelation that does justice to it.\" Walter Benjamin - The Origin of German Tragic Drama There are secrets that are kept from the public and then there are \"public secrets\" - secrets that the public chooses to keep safe from itself, like the troubling  \"don't ask, don't tell.\" The trick to the public secret is in knowing what not to know. This is the most powerful form of social knowledge. Such shared secrets sustain social and political institutions. The injustices of the war on drugs, the criminal justice system, and the Prison Industrial Complex are \"public secrets.\" The public perception of justice - the figure of its appearance - relies on the public not acknowledging that which is generally known. When faced with massive sociological phenomena such as racism, poverty, addiction, abuse, it is easy to slip into denial. This is the ideological work that the prison does. It allows us to avoid the ethical by relying on the juridical.The expansion of the prison system is possible because it is a public secret - a secret kept in an unacknowledged but public agreement not to know what imprisonment really means to individuals and their communities. As the number of prisons increases, so does the level of secrecy about what goes on inside them. The secret of the abuses perpetrated by the Criminal Justice System and Prison Industrial Complex can be heard in many stories told by many narrators, but only when they are allowed to speak. After a series of news stories and lawsuits documenting egregious mistreatment of prisoners in 1993, the California Department of Corrections imposed a media ban on all of its facilities. This ongoing ban prohibits journalists from face-to-face interviews, eliminates prisoners' right to confidential correspondence with media representatives, and bars the use of cameras, recording devices, and writing instruments in interviews with media representatives. Women incarcerated in California are allowed visits only from family members and legal representatives. Inmates are not allowed access to computers, cameras, tape recorders or media equipment of any kind. Such restrictions preserve the public secret.For the past three years, I have visited the Central California Women's Facility [CCWF] as a legal advocate. I work with a non-profit, human rights organization, Justice Now. Together we have been documenting conversations with women prisoners at CCWF, the largest female correctional facility in the United States in an effort to unmask the well known, yet still secret injustices that result from our society's reliance on prisons to solve social problems. Given the ban on conversations with the media, I would not have had access to the women who have contributed to Public Secrets without the support of Justice Now. As a \"legal advocate\" I am allowed to record my conversations with the women and solicit their stories, ideas, and opinions.The visits require adherence to Kafkaesque regulations and acceptance of invasive search and surveillance procedures. I am registered for each visit in advance and searched on entry. I am allowed to bring in only a clear plastic baggie with a clear ink pen, my drivers license, a blank legal pad and my mini-disc recorder. The recorder has to be approved weeks in advance (the serial number is registered and checked) and the device is inspected on entry and exit. Only factory-sealed discs are permitted in. After our interviews the women are subject to strip search and visual body cavity searches that may be performed by male guards. Clearly, the women I work with are highly politicized and are seriously committed to this endeavor. For these women our conversations are acts of ethical and political testimony - testimony that challenges the underlying principles of distributive justice and the dehumanizing mechanisms of the prison system. They are quite literally historians and theorists who speak out in an effort of collective resistance. I collaborate with them first as a witness and then as a \"context provider.\" After soliciting their opinions and collecting their stories, it is my responsibility to create a context in which their voices can be heard across social, cultural and economic boundaries. My  conversations with these women form the basis of Public Secrets which in turn brings their voices into dialogue with other legal, political and social theorists such as Giorgio Agamben, Michael Taussig, Walter Benjamin, Fredric Jameson, Catherine MacKinnon, and Angela Davis. While this is a dialogue that I have constructed between interlocutors whose perspectives originate from very diverse social locations, for me all of their voices emerge out of a shared ethos and converge in critical resistance. The linking of these voices that occurs in Public Secrets originated in an essay \"The Public Secret: Information and Social Knowledge\"  that I wrote for a special issue of the online journal Intelligent Agent. The essay also provided a point of departure for the design of the data structure that organizes the content of Public Secrets. In all of this work, I see the public secret as an aporia - an irresolvable internal contradiction, between power and knowledge, between information and denial, between the masks of politics and the goals of an open society (one in which the state is expected to act for the people as guarantor of human and civil rights). Building on this concept, we have created three main branches within Public Secrets, each structured as an aporia; inside/outside, bare-life/human-life, and public secret/utopia. Each aporia frames multiple themes and threads elaborated in clusters of narrative, theory and evidence. Together they explore the space of the prison - physical, economic, political and ideological - and how the space of the prison acts back on the space outside to disrupt and, in effect, undermine the very forms of legality, security and freedom that the prison system purportedly protects.  Three years ago, on visiting day, I walked through a metal detector and into the Central California Womens' Facility. It changed my life. The stories I heard inside challenged my most basic perceptions - of our system of justice, of freedom and of responsibility. Walk with me across this boundary between inside and outside, bare-life and human-life, and listen to Public Secrets.— Sharon Daniel\\\\n\\n\\t\\n\\tPublic Secrets\\n\\t\\nBy Sharon Daniel\\nDesign by Erik LoyerDesigner's StatementSharon Daniel brought up treemaps as a visual motif very early in the design process for Public Secrets.  I was initially resistant to the idea—frequently things get a bit literal at that stage and I was worried that screens filled with rectangles would feel simplistic or cliché in the context of a project dealing with the prison industrial complex.  As our visual explorations proceeded, however, I found myself drawn back to treemap visualizations because they embody both a utopian relationship between the individual and the state, and its opposite as we find it in the abuses endemic to our system of incarceration. To generate a treemap, one provides the algorithm with the dimensions of a rectangle and a list of items to be laid out within it, along with a value for each item.  When given this information, the algorithm grants each item a rectangle the area of which is proportional to the item's value.  The algorithm also calculates the position and dimensions of each rectangle so that all them taken together exactly fill their enclosing shape.  To put it another way, if I've got a box and a bunch of things to put in it, the treemap algorithm makes all those things fit in the box perfectly, while preserving their relative size relationships.We use treemapping in Public Secrets as a metaphor rather than as a visualization as the algorithm was originally intended; the proportional relationships between our rectangles are randomly generated or in some cases, fixed.  We've also developed our own typographic riff on the treemap, in the form of a routine that dynamically arranges type to fit the dimensions of a rectangle as closely as possible while retaining visual interest, readability and beauty.  Both algorithms are combinations of the individual and the authoritarian, conforming exactly to the dimensions of content while organizing that content to conform exactly to the structures that enclose it.The more I worked with these algorithms, the more I found them to be patently seductive 'black boxes\" in which words could be made beautiful even as they were compelled to conform to the dimensions of their containers.  I was pleased to discover that with the combination of our treemap and typographic algorithms, we could put anything anywhere and it would fit.  It became easy to overlook the occasional rendering glitch or phrase shrunk too small to be readable because the program itself was doing such an excellent job of solving the aesthetic problem: how do I make all this stuff fit and still look good? Of course, \"make it fit and look good\" as a design rationale is hardly sufficient, but neither could we ignore the affordances our algorithms brought us in concept and aesthetics.  In fact, the design process itself thus came to resonate with the broader task of reconciling the needs of the state with the rights of the individual, with all of its concomitant messiness and imperfection.  Having chosen the aesthetic practicality of an all-encompassing algorithm, Sharon and I found ourselves walking the razor's edge, constantly challenged to keep the algorithm accountable to the content it contained while retaining its essential nature as an automatic process rather than as a collection of exceptions. The final product is flawed, of course.  Sometimes things still get a bit mangled or look a little strange.  Many of these are problems that we chose to leave alone because the fix would either be too costly in terms of time or could break some other more critical aspect of the system.  Wherever possible, however, we tried to modify the form to best serve the purpose of the content.  And while people are much more than content, prisons much more than form, and metaphors ultimately unable to do justice to the magnitude of what is going on in the lives of the women who testify here, such microcosmic resonances can indeed bear witness to what must be done in response.— Erik Loyer","citation_source_nom":"","citation_source_url":"","date":"2007","perspectives":"","mediums":"","materiaux":"","genres":"","pays":"","collections":"vectors-journal","organisations":"","video":"https://vimeo.com/180025973/8d0e91858b#t=4791s","images":["data/fe7e8205-d845-4286-b84a-89a78aa5633a.png"],"preview":"","plateformes":"","tags":"sociologie, audio, dessin, texte","répertoires":"","technologies":"","description":"\\n\\t\\n\\tPublic Secrets\\n\\t\\nBy Sharon Daniel\\nDesign by Erik LoyerEditor's IntroductionTo many, central California is perhaps best known as the heart of a large agriculture business, a vast terrain of plowed fields abutting the state's main thoroughfare, the I-5.  Less obvious from the confines of the freeway is another rapidly expanding industry within the region, the state's massive prison system.  As Sharon Daniel narrates in the voice over that opens this project, a thirty square mile area near Chowchilla houses three prisons, including the two largest women's prisons in the world.  Public Secrets reconfigures the physical, psychological, and ideological spaces of the prison, allowing us to learn about life inside the prison along several thematic pathways and from multiple points of view.  Through a thoughtful and respectful framing and layering of the voices of individual women, we get a view from inside but also a view in context.      Moving through the many voices brought together here, you are asked to listen with care to new points of view and to examine prisons from the inside out.

Tourism at plantation sites has surged in recent years.  The visitor to these locales surveys a very particular past, for tour guides typically focus on architectural spectacle and period furnishings as they sketch a specific (and usually white-washed) history of ephemeral southern grandeur.  The visiting tourist is powerfully positioned within a mise-en-scene of imagined hospitality, an immersive experience underwritten both by the mansions' scale and lush settings and by the simultaneous erasure of virtually all traces of slavery.  The visitor is swept into a stage set ripe for fantasy, creating a powerful scene for the projection of romance and structuring a sort of mobility through an imagined space of history.  This fantasy unfolds in an isolated temporal and geographic zone, narrativized as separate in space and time, a lost moment reflecting a 'gentler' past that mustn't be disturbed by the ghostly presence of the slave.  These tours serve to freeze the possible meanings of the South, the plantation, and the past along very narrow registers.Slavery's Ephemera pries open these affective registers and powerfully insists that the plantation be reanimated via its many complex, embedded, and embodied histories.  Designed as a companion piece to Judith Jackson Fossett's book manuscript on the lingering presence of the plantation today, the project reflects upon and recombines the results of three extensive research trips to antebellum sites in southern Louisiana.  In authoring an 'alternative narrative' of plantation geographies and architectures, Fossett, working with Erik Loyer, also crafts an alternative immersive experience.  The tour they construct refuses the neat linearity and simple closures that dominate the experience of the traditional plantation tour.  As you explore the piece, you are not led through a carefully orchestrated narrative along a lovely landscaped path.  Rather, you encounter various sites, artifacts, and images that seemingly float free of one place or one time.

Was I some tourist who flitted through these overwrought landscapes like a ghost?  Could my presence—as a black woman, without local accent—be tolerated at the remains of plantation complexes and plantation sites only if I was discursively placed as not being \"from 'round here\"?So, as much as I could, I played the part of tourist for the research for this project on the contemporary life of the antebellum plantation in the U.S. imagination.  But, as I did the research and after, the role of tourist within these spaces always seemed like an ill-fitting garment—I dressed in what parts I could and made do:  in rural Louisiana, I was usually the only black person on a tour with whites from the U.S. and Europe; I was usually the only black person who paid an entrance fee and was not an employee of the plantation museum/foundation; I was usually the only academic doing research and \"played\" tourist to learn what was said on the \"regular\" tour.  What is the nature of the ephemeral within tourist spaces, but also within institutional and cultural phenomena which purportedly no longer exist, like chattel slavery in the New World? As I surveyed my substantial haul of tourist ephemera—pamphlets, brochures, paper fans with family histories on their flipsides, Mammy doll plantation magnets—and the extensive photographic record that I compiled during three different research trips, I yearned for innovative ways to tell the story of slavery's ephemera, of its afterlife, of an 'undead' seemingly alive and well in south Louisiana.  Having given conventional academic presentations of this research, complete with dozens of slides, on several occasions, I found audiences eager for the talk, but either still enraptured by the glories of a plantation ideal already hard-wired in their U.S. perceptions of the 'good life' or completely ignorant of any reference to white columns, including Gone With the Wind.

Tourism at plantation sites has surged in recent years.  The visitor to these locales surveys a very particular past, for tour guides typically focus on architectural spectacle and period furnishings as they sketch a specific (and usually white-washed) history of ephemeral southern grandeur.  The visiting tourist is powerfully positioned within a mise-en-scene of imagined hospitality, an immersive experience underwritten both by the mansions' scale and lush settings and by the simultaneous erasure of virtually all traces of slavery.  The visitor is swept into a stage set ripe for fantasy, creating a powerful scene for the projection of romance and structuring a sort of mobility through an imagined space of history.  This fantasy unfolds in an isolated temporal and geographic zone, narrativized as separate in space and time, a lost moment reflecting a 'gentler' past that mustn't be disturbed by the ghostly presence of the slave.  These tours serve to freeze the possible meanings of the South, the plantation, and the past along very narrow registers.Slavery's Ephemera pries open these affective registers and powerfully insists that the plantation be reanimated via its many complex, embedded, and embodied histories.  Designed as a companion piece to Judith Jackson Fossett's book manuscript on the lingering presence of the plantation today, the project reflects upon and recombines the results of three extensive research trips to antebellum sites in southern Louisiana.  In authoring an 'alternative narrative' of plantation geographies and architectures, Fossett, working with Erik Loyer, also crafts an alternative immersive experience.  The tour they construct refuses the neat linearity and simple closures that dominate the experience of the traditional plantation tour.  As you explore the piece, you are not led through a carefully orchestrated narrative along a lovely landscaped path.  Rather, you encounter various sites, artifacts, and images that seemingly float free of one place or one time.

Importantly, the piece enacts its argument, requiring its user to explore this virtual archive in order to access the argument constructed there via the user's own navigations.  The argument is emergent, unfolding as the user becomes more and more immersed in the piece itself.  It stands as a provocative and playful example of experiential argument, pushing scholarly practices such as research, annotation, and citation in lively new directions.This archive also encapsulates and preserves a history of labor practices, limning both the oppressive and the expressive potentials encapsulated in a variety of office work and office machines.  As such, it offers evidence to the creativity of all manner of text workers.  Such histories are vitally important in a moment such as our own when the forces of globalization seem to encourage our seamless incorporation into capital and the networks through which it flows.  Stolen Time reminds us of resistance.While the piece bears a clear relationship to Writing Is Work, the book that Gambrell is now completing, Stolen Time is not simply a translation of that print project to the digital realm.  It stands easily alone, obeying its own internal principles while radically reworking our understanding of form's relationship to content.  The project's 'design' or 'form' is not separable from the 'content' or 'argument' it makes.  Such an argument may seem self-evident in the tantalizing realms of the digital, but Stolen Time also historicizes this relationship, underscoring that that form and content, or, put differently, the technical and the creative, have always existed in tight feedback loops.  The construction of the project literalized these circuits of exchange as Gambrell and Kelly collaborated in an intense production process.  While we've long been urged not to judge a book by its cover, Stolen Time powerfully insists that such an adage works to conceal the myriad traces of labor that congeal in any textual artifact.  As such, the project offers another take on a claim that Vectors as a whole seeks to make: the long-standing scholarly distinction between tools and theories is profoundly destabilized by digital media, demanding a rethinking of long-held tenets of technological determinism.-- Tara McPherson and Steve Anderson\\\\n\\r\\nAuthor's StatementPlay at WorkOff and on throughout the second half of 2004, Raegan Kelly and I worked on Stolen Time, a collaborative experiment in the ordering, interpretation, and distribution of a particular kind of evidence. Stolen Time is constructed around a small group of ephemeral materials produced by, for, and about office workers in the twentieth-century United States. On one hand, the archive includes didactic texts and objects (handbook entries, magazine advertisements, secretary gifts, industrial guides -- most of them from the 1940s and 1950s) whose primary purpose was to maximize office-worker productivity. On the other, however, it also includes more resistant texts: primarily zines that were self-published on the fly by office workers themselves -- cut and pasted, handmade, duplicated, and informally distributed -- over the course of the last twenty-five or so years. Since elements in the first category provide much of the subject matter and motivation for elements in the second, the relationship between the two turns out to be intimate and combative in equal measures.Once you have gained access to the collection, you will be permitted to summon up archival texts and objects that have been subjected to processes of digital reproduction, annotation, and arrangement within a sequence of alphabetized and cross-referenced filing categories. The files are sorted by subject under three main headings -- 'forms,\" \"personnel,\" and \"production\" -- and you may examine them in whatever order and to whatever duration and extent you choose. Your own research process, in turn, will be tracked and recorded in the form of an evolving, cut-and-mixed collage through which idiosyncratic sets of meanings and alternative modes of access to the archive will emerge. Then, when you are done rifling through the files, you will be asked to activate a series of copying functions that will leave you with a ghostly remapping of your own interaction with Stolen Time. These screen-based 'photocopies' will gradually disclose abstracted layers of information: about the archival objects that you have examined, about their rapidly receding histories, and (finally) about the recent movements of your own hand on the mouse or the touch-pad. As such, as you make your way through Stolen Time, you will be called upon to participate in a series of uncanny improvisations upon the most familiar, rule-governed, technical functions of office work, including transcription, storage and retrieval of information, and copying. That these are also the most basic functions performed within the process of \"creative/intellectual\" authorship is one of the interpretive sticking points of the project.Lev Manovich observed in a 2000 Switch interview with Inna Razumova that in the present moment, work interfaces frequently coincide (on the computer screen) with the interfaces of play; many of the nuances of Raegan Kelly's project design for Stolen Time draw heightened attention to this decidedly contemporary phenomenon. At the same time, however, the design and contents of Stolen Time also look back to a much longer history within which the tools of office work (ordinary supplies and machines, including pencils, copiers, file folders, typewriters, etc.) have  been put to work in the services of the most common form of intra-office mischief-making: \"time theft.\" (For those of you fortunate enough not to have encountered the recent managerial moral panics surrounding \"time theft,\" the phrase refers to the \"theft\" of the boss's time -- not to mention the boss's office supplies -- by workers who engage, on the job, in work or play of their own.)As an experimental archive, Stolen Time means to encourage visitors to think about the mixed significances communicated by any public collection of primary documents and objects: an archive is a practical resource, of course, but it is also (by virtue of practices of inclusion, exclusion, arrangement, annotation, display, and mode of access) a kind of argument. The contents of Stolen Time are displayed through a series of interactive functions, conceived and created by Kelly, that evoke the dynamic relationship between work and play -- a relationship that is on one hand oppositional, and on the other mutually constitutive and densely intertwined. Above all, Stolen Time (through its design and contents as well as through the collaboration between Kelly and myself) means to point up the futility of efforts to draw clear distinctions between so-called \"creative/intellectual\" and \"technical\" contributions to the making of any text, by concentrating on those moments when the brutal inevitabilities of wage labor and the transitory pleasures of creativity cross over and blur together.Antonio Gramsci, in a prison notebooks entry (1929-34), took up a cluster of related topics in a brief, intensely moving discussion of early-twentieth-century Taylorist managerial strategies: these strategies, which impinged powerfully upon U.S. text-workers during the early decades of the twentieth century, were designed to maximize productivity by subjecting workers to minute bodily scrutiny (in the form of \"time and motion study\"), in order to render the human employee as mindlessly efficient as any machine (or as Gramsci also put it, as any \"'trained gorilla'\") might be. Focussing specifically on what I call \"text work\" (and what Gramsci called \"the professions connected with the reproduction of texts for publication\"), Gramsci observed:\\t... if one really thinks about it, the effort that these workers have to make in order to isolate from the often fascinating intellectual content of a text (and the more fascinating it is the less work is done and the less well) its written symbolization, this perhaps is the greatest effort that can be required in any trade. However it is done, and it is not the spiritual death of man.According to Gramsci, once the rote, mechanical gestures of text work (stenography, typing, etc.) are mastered, the \"brain of the worker\" is able to achieve \"a state of complete freedom,\" creating the conditions for \"train[s] of thought that [are] far from conformist.\"Gramsci's remarks are usefully (and characteristically) double-valenced, acknowledging as they do both the limits and the possibilities contained within the intellectual labor performed in the text-making trades. For example, the typist at the center of T.S. Eliot's The Waste Land, blanked-out and apparently insensate while she is being poked at by the \"young man carbuncular,\" serves simultaneously as an ambivalent rendering of a (very modern) sexually active office worker, and as an anticipatory refusal of the Gramscian dream of a \"state of complete freedom.\" At the same time, however, Eliot's own radical poetic practice, which encompassed the filtering, manipulation, and transmission of received texts ranging from the Upanishads to The Tempest to Leaves of Grass, bears a clear (if largely displaced) relationship to the day-to-day drudgeries of text work: taking dictation, organizing and reorganizing documents, making copies, and the like.Pencils, typewriters, file folders, duplicating machinery: in the text-making trades, the tools used for mind-numbing and body-abusing work are the same tools used elsewhere (or, in the case of creative time-thievery, tools used in the same time and place) for invigorating intellectual play, so much so that the rule-governed pain of wage labor and the fugitive pleasures of creativity have tended to mix into each other (as they did, at that charged moment in Eliot's poem) in all sorts of volatile combinations. Brutal containment and radical inventiveness are contrasting possibilities that intermingle in the design and in the contents of the Stolen Time project as well, where we mean to ask you to think hard about what it means to make work out of art, and to make art out of work.This present project is preceded by an array of efforts to organize and preserve the profuse but largely ephemeral material culture of the twentieth-century U.S. office. Major predecessors include Rider University's magisterial special collections, which encompass massive holdings in the histories of shorthand, typewriting, and business education; Alan Dundes' and Carl Pagter's meticulous scholarly gatherings and analyses of office-based humor, a genre that Dundes and Pagter have referred to as \"folklore by fax\"; Donald Albrecht's and Chyrsanthe Broikos's on the job: design and the american office (the companion volume to a 2000 exhibition at the National Building Museum); and numerous Web-based itineraries like \"The Virtual Typewriter Museum,\" \"The Shannon L. Johnson Typewriter Collection,\" and the \"World Typewriter and Keyboard Museum.\"Stolen Time shares with all of these a fundamental impulse, which is to draw attention to office work as a multivalent, skill-intensive, radiantly complicated process, rather than as a blank, bland, largely mechanical generator of product. Where Stolen Time differs from its archival predecessors is in its relentless scrutiny of a series of key contradictions -- having to do with identity and difference, pleasure and pain, privilege and subordination, visibility and invisibility, freedom and containment -- within which office work and office workers have long been enmeshed. In this, the key antecedent of Stolen Time is the venerable Bay Area zine Processed World, whose contents are represented within the archive itself. During the zine's twenty-three year run, PW editors published a marvelous series of photocopied collages -- most of them fashioned from recycled bits and pieces of the industrial literatures of office work. These were a main inspiration for the dual interface of Stolen Time, where the collage stands alongside the alphabetical filing system as an alternative method for arranging, preserving, and displaying received information.The Stolen Time project also situates itself at a point  where several distinct scholarly conversations  converge: a long-standing labor-history literature; a literature concerned with the sociology and anthropology of office work; and finally, a quite recent flowering of literary criticism that takes up  the relationship between clerical work, medial technologies, and literary expression. Stolen Time was generated by (but by virtue of its form and emphases is very different from) my own print-based work-in-progress, a book  titled Writing is Work that got underway in the late nineties. In that (ongoing) project, I try to come to terms with the extent to which left-political writings produced in the U.S. during the second half of the twentieth century were shot through with anxious (and often with disparaging) references to clerical work and/or clerical workers. This research has led me to consider a broad range of topics including the definition of \"intellectual labor,\" the composition of community newspapers, the protocols associated with minutes-taking, the dynamics of the \"day job,\" and the late-twentieth-century politics of independent publishing (especially zines). In the book project I am trying to open up fresh possibilities in a (collective, ongoing) effort to map out a history of U.S.-based feminist activism and analysis within which questions about gender have long been entwined with (rather than being distinct from) questions about class, race, sexuality, and citizenship. Where Stolen Time differs from its scholarly predecessors across a range of disciplines, as well as from my own ongoing print work, is in its steady focus upon the ambiguities embedded within the everyday texts and objects of office work.The scope of this project is potentially vast, but has been contained here by a number of factors -- most important among them the difficulty of the permissions process and the enormous amount of time that gets consumed in the making of any electronic project; these determined that in most cases we reproduce only small portions of texts, rather than wholes. What you will find in Stolen Time, as such, is not a comprehensive collection, but an eccentrically imagined floor plan for a file room of the future that has a close if contentious relationship to file rooms of the past. Many of the elements catalogued here bear marks of use and handling (marginal scribbles, staple holes, eraser smudges) left prior to their inclusion in the project. A few of them, as you will observe, have endured some seriously rough handling before coming into our possession: some were torn from their earlier contexts by ephemera dealers, a process that left their provenances mysterious, and others were shoddily microfilmed for library distribution and then left to decay. (Rough prior handling, by the way, isn't always a bad thing; a broken wind-up doll represented in the archive -- with her mechanical parts exposed -- turns out to be one of the most evocative items in the collection.)The objects displayed here, whatever their provenance, have been frozen at a particular and admittedly arbitrary point in their own, ongoing histories, so that future traces left upon them by viewers of Stolen Time will not be palpable in the same way they would be in a physical archive. I count this as a loss, but it is a loss that Raegan and I have attempted to recuperate by inviting you to leave other sorts of (virtual) marks upon the project as you make your way through it. As strange as the notion of a dust-free archive will be to many of you, we hope that Stolen Time will in other respects feel familiar and usable to visitors whose primary allegiance has traditionally been to paper documents, or to more tangible, more solid objects than those you will encounter here.Note:  Antonio Gramsci's \"Taylorism and the Mechanization of the Worker\" can be found in An Antonio Gramsci Reader: Selected Writings 1916-1935, ed.

Importantly, the piece enacts its argument, requiring its user to explore this virtual archive in order to access the argument constructed there via the user's own navigations.  The argument is emergent, unfolding as the user becomes more and more immersed in the piece itself.  It stands as a provocative and playful example of experiential argument, pushing scholarly practices such as research, annotation, and citation in lively new directions.This archive also encapsulates and preserves a history of labor practices, limning both the oppressive and the expressive potentials encapsulated in a variety of office work and office machines.  As such, it offers evidence to the creativity of all manner of text workers.  Such histories are vitally important in a moment such as our own when the forces of globalization seem to encourage our seamless incorporation into capital and the networks through which it flows.  Stolen Time reminds us of resistance.While the piece bears a clear relationship to Writing Is Work, the book that Gambrell is now completing, Stolen Time is not simply a translation of that print project to the digital realm.  It stands easily alone, obeying its own internal principles while radically reworking our understanding of form's relationship to content.  The project's 'design' or 'form' is not separable from the 'content' or 'argument' it makes.  Such an argument may seem self-evident in the tantalizing realms of the digital, but Stolen Time also historicizes this relationship, underscoring that that form and content, or, put differently, the technical and the creative, have always existed in tight feedback loops.  The construction of the project literalized these circuits of exchange as Gambrell and Kelly collaborated in an intense production process.  While we've long been urged not to judge a book by its cover, Stolen Time powerfully insists that such an adage works to conceal the myriad traces of labor that congeal in any textual artifact.  As such, the project offers another take on a claim that Vectors as a whole seeks to make: the long-standing scholarly distinction between tools and theories is profoundly destabilized by digital media, demanding a rethinking of long-held tenets of technological determinism.-- Tara McPherson and Steve Anderson\\\\n\\r\\nAuthor's StatementPlay at WorkOff and on throughout the second half of 2004, Raegan Kelly and I worked on Stolen Time, a collaborative experiment in the ordering, interpretation, and distribution of a particular kind of evidence. Stolen Time is constructed around a small group of ephemeral materials produced by, for, and about office workers in the twentieth-century United States. On one hand, the archive includes didactic texts and objects (handbook entries, magazine advertisements, secretary gifts, industrial guides -- most of them from the 1940s and 1950s) whose primary purpose was to maximize office-worker productivity. On the other, however, it also includes more resistant texts: primarily zines that were self-published on the fly by office workers themselves -- cut and pasted, handmade, duplicated, and informally distributed -- over the course of the last twenty-five or so years. Since elements in the first category provide much of the subject matter and motivation for elements in the second, the relationship between the two turns out to be intimate and combative in equal measures.Once you have gained access to the collection, you will be permitted to summon up archival texts and objects that have been subjected to processes of digital reproduction, annotation, and arrangement within a sequence of alphabetized and cross-referenced filing categories. The files are sorted by subject under three main headings -- 'forms,\" \"personnel,\" and \"production\" -- and you may examine them in whatever order and to whatever duration and extent you choose. Your own research process, in turn, will be tracked and recorded in the form of an evolving, cut-and-mixed collage through which idiosyncratic sets of meanings and alternative modes of access to the archive will emerge. Then, when you are done rifling through the files, you will be asked to activate a series of copying functions that will leave you with a ghostly remapping of your own interaction with Stolen Time. These screen-based 'photocopies' will gradually disclose abstracted layers of information: about the archival objects that you have examined, about their rapidly receding histories, and (finally) about the recent movements of your own hand on the mouse or the touch-pad. As such, as you make your way through Stolen Time, you will be called upon to participate in a series of uncanny improvisations upon the most familiar, rule-governed, technical functions of office work, including transcription, storage and retrieval of information, and copying. That these are also the most basic functions performed within the process of \"creative/intellectual\" authorship is one of the interpretive sticking points of the project.Lev Manovich observed in a 2000 Switch interview with Inna Razumova that in the present moment, work interfaces frequently coincide (on the computer screen) with the interfaces of play; many of the nuances of Raegan Kelly's project design for Stolen Time draw heightened attention to this decidedly contemporary phenomenon. At the same time, however, the design and contents of Stolen Time also look back to a much longer history within which the tools of office work (ordinary supplies and machines, including pencils, copiers, file folders, typewriters, etc.) have  been put to work in the services of the most common form of intra-office mischief-making: \"time theft.\" (For those of you fortunate enough not to have encountered the recent managerial moral panics surrounding \"time theft,\" the phrase refers to the \"theft\" of the boss's time -- not to mention the boss's office supplies -- by workers who engage, on the job, in work or play of their own.)As an experimental archive, Stolen Time means to encourage visitors to think about the mixed significances communicated by any public collection of primary documents and objects: an archive is a practical resource, of course, but it is also (by virtue of practices of inclusion, exclusion, arrangement, annotation, display, and mode of access) a kind of argument. The contents of Stolen Time are displayed through a series of interactive functions, conceived and created by Kelly, that evoke the dynamic relationship between work and play -- a relationship that is on one hand oppositional, and on the other mutually constitutive and densely intertwined. Above all, Stolen Time (through its design and contents as well as through the collaboration between Kelly and myself) means to point up the futility of efforts to draw clear distinctions between so-called \"creative/intellectual\" and \"technical\" contributions to the making of any text, by concentrating on those moments when the brutal inevitabilities of wage labor and the transitory pleasures of creativity cross over and blur together.Antonio Gramsci, in a prison notebooks entry (1929-34), took up a cluster of related topics in a brief, intensely moving discussion of early-twentieth-century Taylorist managerial strategies: these strategies, which impinged powerfully upon U.S. text-workers during the early decades of the twentieth century, were designed to maximize productivity by subjecting workers to minute bodily scrutiny (in the form of \"time and motion study\"), in order to render the human employee as mindlessly efficient as any machine (or as Gramsci also put it, as any \"'trained gorilla'\") might be. Focussing specifically on what I call \"text work\" (and what Gramsci called \"the professions connected with the reproduction of texts for publication\"), Gramsci observed:\\t... if one really thinks about it, the effort that these workers have to make in order to isolate from the often fascinating intellectual content of a text (and the more fascinating it is the less work is done and the less well) its written symbolization, this perhaps is the greatest effort that can be required in any trade. However it is done, and it is not the spiritual death of man.According to Gramsci, once the rote, mechanical gestures of text work (stenography, typing, etc.) are mastered, the \"brain of the worker\" is able to achieve \"a state of complete freedom,\" creating the conditions for \"train[s] of thought that [are] far from conformist.\"Gramsci's remarks are usefully (and characteristically) double-valenced, acknowledging as they do both the limits and the possibilities contained within the intellectual labor performed in the text-making trades. For example, the typist at the center of T.S. Eliot's The Waste Land, blanked-out and apparently insensate while she is being poked at by the \"young man carbuncular,\" serves simultaneously as an ambivalent rendering of a (very modern) sexually active office worker, and as an anticipatory refusal of the Gramscian dream of a \"state of complete freedom.\" At the same time, however, Eliot's own radical poetic practice, which encompassed the filtering, manipulation, and transmission of received texts ranging from the Upanishads to The Tempest to Leaves of Grass, bears a clear (if largely displaced) relationship to the day-to-day drudgeries of text work: taking dictation, organizing and reorganizing documents, making copies, and the like.Pencils, typewriters, file folders, duplicating machinery: in the text-making trades, the tools used for mind-numbing and body-abusing work are the same tools used elsewhere (or, in the case of creative time-thievery, tools used in the same time and place) for invigorating intellectual play, so much so that the rule-governed pain of wage labor and the fugitive pleasures of creativity have tended to mix into each other (as they did, at that charged moment in Eliot's poem) in all sorts of volatile combinations. Brutal containment and radical inventiveness are contrasting possibilities that intermingle in the design and in the contents of the Stolen Time project as well, where we mean to ask you to think hard about what it means to make work out of art, and to make art out of work.This present project is preceded by an array of efforts to organize and preserve the profuse but largely ephemeral material culture of the twentieth-century U.S. office. Major predecessors include Rider University's magisterial special collections, which encompass massive holdings in the histories of shorthand, typewriting, and business education; Alan Dundes' and Carl Pagter's meticulous scholarly gatherings and analyses of office-based humor, a genre that Dundes and Pagter have referred to as \"folklore by fax\"; Donald Albrecht's and Chyrsanthe Broikos's on the job: design and the american office (the companion volume to a 2000 exhibition at the National Building Museum); and numerous Web-based itineraries like \"The Virtual Typewriter Museum,\" \"The Shannon L. Johnson Typewriter Collection,\" and the \"World Typewriter and Keyboard Museum.\"Stolen Time shares with all of these a fundamental impulse, which is to draw attention to office work as a multivalent, skill-intensive, radiantly complicated process, rather than as a blank, bland, largely mechanical generator of product. Where Stolen Time differs from its archival predecessors is in its relentless scrutiny of a series of key contradictions -- having to do with identity and difference, pleasure and pain, privilege and subordination, visibility and invisibility, freedom and containment -- within which office work and office workers have long been enmeshed. In this, the key antecedent of Stolen Time is the venerable Bay Area zine Processed World, whose contents are represented within the archive itself. During the zine's twenty-three year run, PW editors published a marvelous series of photocopied collages -- most of them fashioned from recycled bits and pieces of the industrial literatures of office work. These were a main inspiration for the dual interface of Stolen Time, where the collage stands alongside the alphabetical filing system as an alternative method for arranging, preserving, and displaying received information.The Stolen Time project also situates itself at a point  where several distinct scholarly conversations  converge: a long-standing labor-history literature; a literature concerned with the sociology and anthropology of office work; and finally, a quite recent flowering of literary criticism that takes up  the relationship between clerical work, medial technologies, and literary expression. Stolen Time was generated by (but by virtue of its form and emphases is very different from) my own print-based work-in-progress, a book  titled Writing is Work that got underway in the late nineties. In that (ongoing) project, I try to come to terms with the extent to which left-political writings produced in the U.S. during the second half of the twentieth century were shot through with anxious (and often with disparaging) references to clerical work and/or clerical workers. This research has led me to consider a broad range of topics including the definition of \"intellectual labor,\" the composition of community newspapers, the protocols associated with minutes-taking, the dynamics of the \"day job,\" and the late-twentieth-century politics of independent publishing (especially zines). In the book project I am trying to open up fresh possibilities in a (collective, ongoing) effort to map out a history of U.S.-based feminist activism and analysis within which questions about gender have long been entwined with (rather than being distinct from) questions about class, race, sexuality, and citizenship. Where Stolen Time differs from its scholarly predecessors across a range of disciplines, as well as from my own ongoing print work, is in its steady focus upon the ambiguities embedded within the everyday texts and objects of office work.The scope of this project is potentially vast, but has been contained here by a number of factors -- most important among them the difficulty of the permissions process and the enormous amount of time that gets consumed in the making of any electronic project; these determined that in most cases we reproduce only small portions of texts, rather than wholes. What you will find in Stolen Time, as such, is not a comprehensive collection, but an eccentrically imagined floor plan for a file room of the future that has a close if contentious relationship to file rooms of the past. Many of the elements catalogued here bear marks of use and handling (marginal scribbles, staple holes, eraser smudges) left prior to their inclusion in the project. A few of them, as you will observe, have endured some seriously rough handling before coming into our possession: some were torn from their earlier contexts by ephemera dealers, a process that left their provenances mysterious, and others were shoddily microfilmed for library distribution and then left to decay. (Rough prior handling, by the way, isn't always a bad thing; a broken wind-up doll represented in the archive -- with her mechanical parts exposed -- turns out to be one of the most evocative items in the collection.)The objects displayed here, whatever their provenance, have been frozen at a particular and admittedly arbitrary point in their own, ongoing histories, so that future traces left upon them by viewers of Stolen Time will not be palpable in the same way they would be in a physical archive.

These secret maps, composed with input from \"competent local real estate brokers and mortgage lenders,\" ranked zones within cities in terms of their desirability for residential investment. The central criterion underpinning the ranking concerned their ethnoracial character. The residential security maps coded affluent and desirable lending zones green and blue, less affluent and less desirable areas yellow, and zones inhabited by blacks--and so deemed undesirable--with the alarmist, high alert red. In 1936, HOLC guidelines made explicit these color-coded residential security maps.The security maps, a central technology of residential planning and management across US cities from the late 1930s on, became the basis across many years to follow for denying mortgage loans by government and private banks especially to black home seekers and in black neighborhoods. They thus fueled racial residential segregation, urban abandonment, and ultimately capital flight, thus hyper-concentrating racial poverty, slum conditions, and urban blight. Today's gated communities are essentially privatized modalities of redlining, segregating communities informally extended. Color-coded maps were produced in the 1930s and 1940s for almost every city in America to delineate—both to describe and determine—what urban areas were to be developed for appealing, secure, and wealth-producing housing for eligible, racially coded population groups, and what areas were to be avoided, ultimately left undeveloped or underdeveloped.  These maps were accompanied by municipal regulations, mortgage company directives, and insurance company missives from the 1930s onwards directing investments and restricting what urban areas would be available for development, gentrification, and support. As the maps and accompanying materials make explicit, public and private mandates combined to code urban housing development and the basis of ensuing suburban formation in straightforwardly racially segregationist terms. The archive reveals, perhaps unsurprisingly for anyone with knowledge of the field but still disturbingly, even chillingly, that those urban areas that remain racially segregated today tend largely to be those that were historically redlined from the mid-1930s onwards. The color-coding of the maps, we note in passing, form the basis also of the contemporary Homeland Security alert system, thus linking histories of urban segregation abstractly to more recent patterns of national restriction.The maps, regulations, and missives are collected at the National Archives. With generous support from the Institute for Museum and Library Services we have constituted a team to digitize the maps and materials, and to develop an easily searchable data base hyper-linking the color-coded maps and written directives generated through Google maps. We began constituting the digital archive of redlined neighborhoods by focusing on the maps and accompanying materials for eight Californian cities (San Diego, Sacramento, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Oakland, San Jose, Stockton, and Fresno).   We eventually hope to expand the archive to include other US cities and additional capabilities: this will form the basis of a new and enhanced interface, which we refer to as \"iRACES.\" The expanded data base will be available through http://www.uchri.org in due course.  In the meantime, the viewers' feedback through Vectors would be much appreciated.The archive will ultimately be hosted on the HASS Grid, a grid network Richard Marciano and David Theo Goldberg have been working with a dedicated team to complete for system-wide Humanities, Arts and Social Sciences across the University of California, where the materials will be available for broad public consultation and use. The archive, we believe, has profound implications for research related to urban studies, history, ethnic studies, geography, American literatures of the urban, cultural studies, conceptions of race and racism, as well as for legal studies and fair housing consideration.— David Theo Goldberg, University of California Humanities Research Institute & Richard Marciano, SILS / University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, September 6th, 2008        \\n\\\\nAs the maps and accompanying materials make explicit, public and private mandates combined to code urban housing development and the basis of ensuing suburban formation in straightforwardly racially segregationist terms.- David Theo Goldberg, Authors' Statement\\n\\nEditor's IntroductionAs I zoom in and out of Google maps, zipping across both scales and continents, it is easy to sustain a fantasy of mastery and control.

These secret maps, composed with input from \"competent local real estate brokers and mortgage lenders,\" ranked zones within cities in terms of their desirability for residential investment. The central criterion underpinning the ranking concerned their ethnoracial character. The residential security maps coded affluent and desirable lending zones green and blue, less affluent and less desirable areas yellow, and zones inhabited by blacks--and so deemed undesirable--with the alarmist, high alert red. In 1936, HOLC guidelines made explicit these color-coded residential security maps.The security maps, a central technology of residential planning and management across US cities from the late 1930s on, became the basis across many years to follow for denying mortgage loans by government and private banks especially to black home seekers and in black neighborhoods. They thus fueled racial residential segregation, urban abandonment, and ultimately capital flight, thus hyper-concentrating racial poverty, slum conditions, and urban blight. Today's gated communities are essentially privatized modalities of redlining, segregating communities informally extended. Color-coded maps were produced in the 1930s and 1940s for almost every city in America to delineate—both to describe and determine—what urban areas were to be developed for appealing, secure, and wealth-producing housing for eligible, racially coded population groups, and what areas were to be avoided, ultimately left undeveloped or underdeveloped.  These maps were accompanied by municipal regulations, mortgage company directives, and insurance company missives from the 1930s onwards directing investments and restricting what urban areas would be available for development, gentrification, and support. As the maps and accompanying materials make explicit, public and private mandates combined to code urban housing development and the basis of ensuing suburban formation in straightforwardly racially segregationist terms. The archive reveals, perhaps unsurprisingly for anyone with knowledge of the field but still disturbingly, even chillingly, that those urban areas that remain racially segregated today tend largely to be those that were historically redlined from the mid-1930s onwards. The color-coding of the maps, we note in passing, form the basis also of the contemporary Homeland Security alert system, thus linking histories of urban segregation abstractly to more recent patterns of national restriction.The maps, regulations, and missives are collected at the National Archives. With generous support from the Institute for Museum and Library Services we have constituted a team to digitize the maps and materials, and to develop an easily searchable data base hyper-linking the color-coded maps and written directives generated through Google maps. We began constituting the digital archive of redlined neighborhoods by focusing on the maps and accompanying materials for eight Californian cities (San Diego, Sacramento, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Oakland, San Jose, Stockton, and Fresno).   We eventually hope to expand the archive to include other US cities and additional capabilities: this will form the basis of a new and enhanced interface, which we refer to as \"iRACES.\" The expanded data base will be available through http://www.uchri.org in due course.  In the meantime, the viewers' feedback through Vectors would be much appreciated.The archive will ultimately be hosted on the HASS Grid, a grid network Richard Marciano and David Theo Goldberg have been working with a dedicated team to complete for system-wide Humanities, Arts and Social Sciences across the University of California, where the materials will be available for broad public consultation and use. The archive, we believe, has profound implications for research related to urban studies, history, ethnic studies, geography, American literatures of the urban, cultural studies, conceptions of race and racism, as well as for legal studies and fair housing consideration.— David Theo Goldberg, University of California Humanities Research Institute & Richard Marciano, SILS / University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, September 6th, 2008        \\n\\\\nAs the maps and accompanying materials make explicit, public and private mandates combined to code urban housing development and the basis of ensuing suburban formation in straightforwardly racially segregationist terms.- David Theo Goldberg, Authors' Statement\\n\\nEditor's IntroductionAs I zoom in and out of Google maps, zipping across both scales and continents, it is easy to sustain a fantasy of mastery and control.  The map is there for my pleasure in this moment, a document I traverse with the swoop of a hand and the glide of a cursor.  But, of course, I know better.  Maps do not so easily yield to my demands.  They are congealed registers of power and ideology, sedimenting and concealing layer upon layer of history and experience in the presumed objectivity of place.  While the increasingly ubiquitous navigation systems of our cars and iPhones promise that digital technologies will allow us to conquer space in the moment we are in (insisting that 'you are here\"), might we deploy these very technologies against the presumed legibility and transparency of the map itself?  Might maps be made to speak their pasts and might we come to understand how these pasts continue to shape our present?  T-RACES aims to do just this.  Bringing together the historical documents of the Home Owners' Loan Corporation (HOLC), a federal agency that helped instantiate practices of redlining, and a Google maps application, the project provides a grounded and textured explanation for continuing practices of segregation in several Californian and North Carolinian cities.T-RACES mashes up a popular commercial platform with public records housed at the National Archives in order to position digital material in a very particular way.  At one level, T-RACES functions as a well-conceived archive, making available in digital form important historical documents concerning urban development and U.S. racial history.   That alone is highly commendable.  However, the vision for the project extends beyond simply providing access to these records.  Rather, the project brings these historical documents together with an informed body of scholarly research, creating the stage for important and timely investigations into the many ways in which the built landscape works in tight feedback loops with social attitudes about race.  Put differently, the project can both provide materials for new scholarly investigations in several humanities disciplines and itself serve as an excellent example of new computationally-driven outcomes for humanities research.  The concerns of scholarship and data preservation are deeply intertwined in the project, enriching both the research and the archive.  This is an archive with a point of view, moving beyond the \"neutral\" presentation of data toward an interpretative modality.

In exploring multiple mediations of this event, Anderson and designer Erik Loyer repeatedly draw our attention to the textured, layered and unstable nature of both historical representation and historical memory.This is an argument about the truth claims of media that is instantiated via media, both through the curated collection of media artifacts assembled here and through their formation into a new interactive experience.

These arguments, in fact, may only be fully articulated through media. By this I do not mean simply taking advantage of the digital format for providing media supplements or illustrations, but literally aiming to think through the media under analysis, developing relationships between media elements themselves, rather than privileging the discursive affordances of text over images. Technologies of History draws substantially on the ideas developed in my book of the same title, but the interactive format allows for a much more detailed and nuanced form of engagement with the historiographical models under consideration. In some ways, then, this project is not primarily about the JFK assassination; but the dense layers of mediation to which this historical event has been subjected provide a particularly rich set of opportunities to think about the construction of history itself. Although certain aspects of the design may initially appear to resist easy navigation, our aim is neither to frustrate the user nor indulge in aestheticized design experiments. The project presents several clearly defined modes of exploration, beginning with the 'Analyzer,\" in which media elements are subjected to a process of tracking and fragmenting designed to simultaneously reveal and obscure the contents of a film or video clip. The user may then follow connections that are suggested by either the video segment or its accompanying text to explore further text arguments or a connection between two media clips. Each connection that is made is logged in the user's history and may be revisited at any time. The experience of moving through the project is therefore intended to be partly experiential and partly curatorial; users may select from categories of content that are based on genre, format or (primarily) threads of historiographical concern.

It's easy to laugh at the technicians, scholars and bureaucrats in some of these clips who seem so earnestly to believe they can recover 'what really happened\" from pixels and grains of silver. And yet, it would be glib to dismiss those efforts entirely—something happened on November 22, 1963 that was photochemically recorded, and those recordings are significant in as much as they are analogues of the energies and trajectories of the photons bouncing around in Dealey Plaza on that day. In a similar way, Anderson reminds us that media retreads of the Kennedy assassination are themselves analogues, not of those photons, but of the memes and ideologies circulating in relation to the event.The main interface of Technologies of History is a kind of visual amplifier which turns up the gain on the unruly tensions inherent in the process of making (and re-making) history.

Likewise, the text of Gibson's auto-encrypting poem is notably absent from the project, apparently as a result of rights issues, but coincidentally offering an allegory for the impossibility of retrieving the thing itself.— Vectors Journal Editorial Staff","collection":"pièces"},{"id":"the-guantanamobile-project","url":"http://vectorsjournal.org/projects/index.php?project=3","titre":"The Guantanamobile Project","personnes":"Lisa Lynch , Elena Razlogova","citation":"\\n\\t\\n\\tThe Guantanamobile Project\\n\\t\\nBy Lisa Lynch & Elena Razlogova\\nDesign by Eric RodenbeckEditor's IntroductionIn July and August 2004, The Guantanamobile Project hit the road, taking a shrink-wrapped, tech-laden van into the streets and parking lots of several Southern and Midwestern cities.

Our interviews with lawyers, activists, and family members of the detainees draw attention to the legal and physical immobility of the detainees, some confined at Guantanamo since late 2001.  And a second set of interviews conducted during the summer of 2004 with Americans in the Midwest and South demonstrate the difficulty of \"mobilizing\" U.S. citizens to become concerned about the situation in Guantanamo, since concern for the detainees required expanding often fixed notions of justice and human rights across the boundaries of nationality, race, and religion. To collect the material for this article, we also had to take advantage of our own relative mobility as U.S.-based academics with (admittedly limited) institutional resources at our disposal, including the support of a Vectors fellowship. Thus, this site is both an extension and a final installment of a larger activist project. In March of 2004, the two of us—a media studies scholar and a historian interested in public scholarship—began to organize a multimedia project about the detention of terror suspects in Guantanamo Bay. Our project grew from an initial news website to a documentary project to a road trip to a film tour; now, we add this piece of online scholarship to our efforts. When we began, the detainees at Guantanamo Bay were of little interest to most Americans—and, for the most part, of little interest to the American media. We wanted to do two things: to try to get as much information about Guantanamo out to as many people as possible, and to try to get a sense of what people really knew or thought about the idea of holding suspected members of the Taliban or Al Qaeda on a base that the Bush Administration claimed was outside of the jurisdiction of U.S. Courts.  With that in mind, we launched a website with information about the project and a news blog. At the same time, we began to plan a road trip through the South and Midwest that would allow us to interview people outside of the Northeast about what they knew about Guantanamo. Somewhere along the way, we decided that we should have something to show these people, so we fitted out a van with an inverter and a rear projection screen and started making a short film about the detainees.  When we went on the road in late July 2004, we had a volunteer crew of 75 people, and had filmed in Germany, England, and around the United States. As we traveled, we interviewed by day and screened by night. Over the course of the past year, we continued working on the film, incorporating the road interviews, and also traveled to universities around the Northeast talking about Guantanamo and the past, present, and future of wartime detention. We also began to focus more closely on the story of Murat Kurnaz, a German-Turkish detainee whose detention and legal proceedings are highlighted in the site we have developed here.By the time we sat down to work on this site for Vectors — about 18 months after the project began — the situation at Guantanamo had, in many ways, changed dramatically. A July 2004 Supreme Court decision had granted detainees the right to file habeas claims in Federal Court, denying the government its assertioin that Guantanamo was somehow outside of the law. The abuse scandal at Abu Ghraib in April 2004 raised concerns about possible abuse in Guantanamo; those fears subsided, and then were reaffirmed by an ACLU FOIA case that produced FBI correspondence about detainee abuse. Reports that the Koran was mistreated at the base caused riots. The New England Journal of Medicine claimed that doctors were violating their professional ethics by aiding investigations. Senate hearings were held in which both Democrats and Republicans were critical of practices at the base, particularly the idea of indefinite detention. And, in the beginning of August, the Pentagon announced that it would try to send most of the detainees to prisons in their home countries.In the face of all of this rapid change, however, it is important to remember that for many of the detainees, things have changed little or not at all. This is certainly true for Murat Kurnaz, the detainee whose story we have tried to tell on this site. According to his lawyer, Kurnaz is a man for whom time stopped in late 2001 — who had no idea, before he was told, that the U.S. had gone to war with Iraq, and who has corresponded only briefly with his family and not at all with his fiancée over the past three-and-one-half years of his detention. Kurnaz's case belies rosy interpretations of the social and political advantages of twenty-first-century mobility.The Guantánamobile Project records and analyzes opinions by participants, experts, and lay Americans while the situation in Guantánamo Base is still undecided. We thus organized our site around interlinked interview clips to convey the provisional state of these debates. At the outset, an audio collage compiles contradictory and conflicting statements our interviewees made about the issue. The main part of the site consists of twelve arguments, organized by topics related to Guantánamo detentions, including Place, Due Process, Torture, Justice, Security, and Media. Each argument is accompanied by a sequence of three interview excerpts in dialogue with each other and with quotes and other evidence we selected to complement or contradict the interviews. Each of the video sequences works as a self-contained unit of argument, but we hope that viewers' understanding of the various layers of the story will develop as they travel from sequence to sequence. We also wrote two essays, on Murat Kurnaz's case and on our road trip, to help viewers to make sense of the interviews.

For an archaeologist schooled in deciphering subtle traces, a lone relic can speak volumes. So it is with the 19th century brass menorah at the center of Andrew Jakubowicz's The Menorah of Fang Bang Lu. Serving as a metaphor for the intertwining stories of four Jewish families living in Shanghai in the late 19th and early 20thcenturies, this object also provides evidence of a community that has since disappeared from the city, having joined the worldwide Jewish diaspora during World War II, only to make their way to Australia. Their stories are told and this history is pieced together through interviews with surviving family members and collections of photographs, documents and testimonies that describe a strikingly similar set of experiences. Jakubowicz's exhaustively documented site offers a model for constructing a multi-perspectival portrait of a moment from the past that cannot be otherwise reconstituted. The family stories that constellate around the image of the menorah describe a set of common themes emerging from individual experiences with immigration, community and participation in an economic system. At the same time, the stories remain separate and distinct, a subtle evocation of the fact that none of the families knew each other when living in Shanghai; it is only through this reconstruction after the fact that their lives have been woven into a larger historical narrative. As a piece of historical evidence whose origins can only be conjectured, the menorah also functions as a metaphor for Jakubowicz's investigation. The graceful folk tune that emanates from the music box in the base of the menorah is at once familiar and indecipherable, some of the notes having been long since worn away, but leaving enough of the tune intact to provide a suggestive starting point for historical enquiry. Like the films of Hungarian Peter Forgacs, who constructs historical narratives out of home movies shot by WWII era European Jewish families, Jakubowicz's work resonates with traditions of oral history and history-from-below, implicitly arguing that the stories of 'ordinary\" people should not be excluded from the historical record.-- Tara McPherson and Steve Anderson\\\\n\\r\\nAuthor's StatementShanghai has an iconic quality in the West - a place out of time and space where cultures explode and opportunities expose themselves. Its physical presence - Victorian waterfront and post-modern skyline - reflect trajectories of empires long lost, and futures spinning relentlessly in many directions. Since its eruption as a Western nodule on the marshy plains along the bend of Whampoo river in the 1850s, Shanghai has evoked that heady mixture of sin and profit that entices new generations to its now ever-more canyon-like streets. My parents were Polish Jewish refugees from Nazism who found respite there during WW2, by then in Japanese-occupied China. It was a curious period, a time of moderate safety and great anxiety, a space within which threatened lives could be held together by the tenuous community and impoverished networks of other refugees. By 1941 when my parents reached the city from Kobe in Japan there were over 30,000 Jews in the city - about 10% of the non-Chinese population, and 1% of the total population. These people had come from Poland, Russia, Manchuria, the former Ottoman empire, India, Turkey, the Nazi occupied countries of Europe (especially Austria and Germany and Czechoslovakia) and a variety of other sources - indeed the whole Jewish diaspora was reflected in the city. I was aware of this story throughout my childhood, and became a fascinated observer of its surfacing into public knowledge as China emerged from the totalitarian isolation of Maoism. Throughout the 1990s I had been interested in the potential of this story to appeal to wide audiences, and to throw light on the serendipitous moments that allowed it to form - although there was academic literature and some popular writing already in print. The 1990s saw the production of a number of documentary films about Shanghai, unearthing archival footage, and generating hundreds of hours of interviews. As well the Visual History Foundation of the Shoah had instigated its 50,000 or more survivor testimony project, and in that group were people who had transitted Shanghai. Meanwhile survivor organisations were establishing websites to provide points of connection, and advance wider global knowledge about the Jews of Shanghai. As a sociologist interested in new media and communication, I had also been involved for some time in the development of educational multimedia. One project, Making Multicultural Australia, had taken six years to reach CD-rom stage (released as a 3 disc set in 1999), and a further five years to be transformed for the Web. That project, a partnership between my research group (Trans/forming Cultures Research CentreSo when the Sydney Jewish Museum decided in 1999 to develop and mount an exhibition on Shanghai and the Jews of China, I became involved in two roles - as a research adviser on the historical detail, and a planner of the thematic structure of the display; and as the producer of an accompanying online component. With Tatiana Pentes as the designer (an award winning multimedia creator), we set out to create a website built around the stories of Jewish families whose paths crossed in Shanghai in the 1940s, and who lived in Sydney at the dawn of the 21st century. In October 2000 I travelled with my partner Mara Moustafine to research the sites of Shanghai and document the city photographically. Mara, born in Harbin in Manchuria, knew the city well and had many contacts there. She had undertaken an earlier visit and had set in train work by local researchers to identify key buildings and locations. One of my goals was to locate each of the places in which my family had lived. Mara's colleague at the Shanghai Academy of Social Sciences, the historian of Russian Shanghai Professor Wang Zhicheng (known as Alexander or Sasha to his friends), had located nearly everything. However the building in Hongkou (historic Hong Kew) in which the family had spent the 'ghetto\" years of 1943 to 1946 had not been found. One Sunday morning Mara and I went to the old Chinese city - now a tourist area with Yu Yuan gardens at its heart. The street leading to the gardens and the famous crooked bridge and teahouse nearby is known as Fang Bang Lu. Near the western end of the street stands an antique and old goods market. As we wandered through the stalls we spotted a brass Star of David in a heap of old brassware. I pulled it free and discovered it was part of a seven-branched candelabra known as a Menorah, and in its base a wind-up music box had been fitted. I bought the piece, and knew then that it would serve as the motif for the website on Shanghai. It was to become \"the Menorah of Fang Bang Lu\". Later that day we found the Dairen Lu rowhouse in Hongkou where my parents had lived - it was about to be demolished. Two weeks later it was gone - and when I went to look for the site in 2002 the street had disappeared under the Hongkou-Pudong metroline. The music box remained an enigma. No one could recognise the tune. In 2003 I had a jeweller friend Ralph Shaw undo the box - and we found that the box, manufactured in Switzerland, had half the tines missing from the comb. No wonder then that it was only playing the upper register of the tune. Ralph could not find a replacement. In October 2004 while at MIT in the USA, I met Tod Machover, a researcher into musical machines at the Media Lab, and mentioned my dilemma. He had just returned the previous weekend from driving in Maine, where in the small town of Wiscasset, Maine he had stopped at \"The Musical Wonder House \", and encountered its owner, an elderly Ukrainian by the name of Mr Konvalinka. He had known a lot about music boxes. I hit Google and found the place and its owner. I emailed him and then telephoned him. I described my problem and he said he would see what he could do. I then phoned Mara's mother, Inna Moustafine, in Australia, who retrieved the box from Ralph, and express posted it to Maine. A few days later Konvalinka phoned and said he could try to fix the box. A week later he phoned again and down the line came the sound of the completed musical comb - playing the old Hebrew Chanukah song \"M'ao Tzur\". Mara recognised it immediately. That dilemma was resolved. But how did a Menorah with a Hebrew melody end up in a Chinese junk shop half a century after the Jewish community left Shanghai? That mystery remains...So where next? The Menorah project suggests a new way of doing research and publishing it. In conjunction with the MIT Metamedia group, we are developing the possibility of a multimedia interactive research archive (labelled \"M.I.R.E\").  In conjunction with museums, libraries, archives, and individual scholars we are creating a selection of multimedia objects - interviews, digitised images, panoramas, video clips, audio files, music, digitised posters, government documents, police files, personal records. Each object is metatagged, carefully coded, and linked to other objects to which it is related. Each object can also have commentaries, arguments and other texts attached (each also metatagged). A tracking device will show how users have used the archive, displaying both heavy pathways and areas of low interest. Finally a publication program will be developed to mobilise the archival elements in online projects. The heartland of the archive as a \"proof of concept\" will be some 150 items from the Menorah of Fang Bang Lu - including the two music-box tunes that serve as bookends to the story. -- Andrew Jakubowicz\\\\n\\r\\nDesigner's StatementTatiana Pentes is a digital media artist. Recently she has produced interactive media works that explore the meeting of documentary and narrative forms in an electronic context.  The projects she has worked on include*  blackBOX online/CD-ROM,* Strange Cities CD-ROM,* The Menorah of Fang Bang Lu online documentary, and recently,* Scenes from a Shanghai Hotel digital DVD film, produced in association with the Australian Film Commission.These projects focus on Shanghai as a cultural milieu in film and literature. Interest in working on these projects has evolved from exploring the émigré experience of her Russian grandparents in Shanghai, China. The legacy of her grandfather Serge Ermoll Snr, jazz musical scores and photographs, memorabilia from his orchestra which once played in the dance halls and cabarets of Shanghai, have inspired a journey back to Shanghai as 'melting pot', an idealised space, and place of refuge/ exile for Russians and Europeans following the second world war.

In October 2000 I travelled with my partner Mara Moustafine to research the sites of Shanghai and document the city photographically. Mara, born in Harbin in Manchuria, knew the city well and had many contacts there. She had undertaken an earlier visit and had set in train work by local researchers to identify key buildings and locations. One of my goals was to locate each of the places in which my family had lived. Mara's colleague at the Shanghai Academy of Social Sciences, the historian of Russian Shanghai Professor Wang Zhicheng (known as Alexander or Sasha to his friends), had located nearly everything. However the building in Hongkou (historic Hong Kew) in which the family had spent the 'ghetto\" years of 1943 to 1946 had not been found. One Sunday morning Mara and I went to the old Chinese city - now a tourist area with Yu Yuan gardens at its heart. The street leading to the gardens and the famous crooked bridge and teahouse nearby is known as Fang Bang Lu. Near the western end of the street stands an antique and old goods market. As we wandered through the stalls we spotted a brass Star of David in a heap of old brassware. I pulled it free and discovered it was part of a seven-branched candelabra known as a Menorah, and in its base a wind-up music box had been fitted. I bought the piece, and knew then that it would serve as the motif for the website on Shanghai. It was to become \"the Menorah of Fang Bang Lu\". Later that day we found the Dairen Lu rowhouse in Hongkou where my parents had lived - it was about to be demolished. Two weeks later it was gone - and when I went to look for the site in 2002 the street had disappeared under the Hongkou-Pudong metroline. The music box remained an enigma. No one could recognise the tune. In 2003 I had a jeweller friend Ralph Shaw undo the box - and we found that the box, manufactured in Switzerland, had half the tines missing from the comb. No wonder then that it was only playing the upper register of the tune. Ralph could not find a replacement. In October 2004 while at MIT in the USA, I met Tod Machover, a researcher into musical machines at the Media Lab, and mentioned my dilemma. He had just returned the previous weekend from driving in Maine, where in the small town of Wiscasset, Maine he had stopped at \"The Musical Wonder House \", and encountered its owner, an elderly Ukrainian by the name of Mr Konvalinka. He had known a lot about music boxes. I hit Google and found the place and its owner. I emailed him and then telephoned him. I described my problem and he said he would see what he could do. I then phoned Mara's mother, Inna Moustafine, in Australia, who retrieved the box from Ralph, and express posted it to Maine. A few days later Konvalinka phoned and said he could try to fix the box. A week later he phoned again and down the line came the sound of the completed musical comb - playing the old Hebrew Chanukah song \"M'ao Tzur\". Mara recognised it immediately. That dilemma was resolved. But how did a Menorah with a Hebrew melody end up in a Chinese junk shop half a century after the Jewish community left Shanghai? That mystery remains...So where next? The Menorah project suggests a new way of doing research and publishing it. In conjunction with the MIT Metamedia group, we are developing the possibility of a multimedia interactive research archive (labelled \"M.I.R.E\").  In conjunction with museums, libraries, archives, and individual scholars we are creating a selection of multimedia objects - interviews, digitised images, panoramas, video clips, audio files, music, digitised posters, government documents, police files, personal records. Each object is metatagged, carefully coded, and linked to other objects to which it is related. Each object can also have commentaries, arguments and other texts attached (each also metatagged). A tracking device will show how users have used the archive, displaying both heavy pathways and areas of low interest. Finally a publication program will be developed to mobilise the archival elements in online projects. The heartland of the archive as a \"proof of concept\" will be some 150 items from the Menorah of Fang Bang Lu - including the two music-box tunes that serve as bookends to the story. -- Andrew Jakubowicz\\\\n\\r\\nDesigner's StatementTatiana Pentes is a digital media artist. Recently she has produced interactive media works that explore the meeting of documentary and narrative forms in an electronic context.  The projects she has worked on include*  blackBOX online/CD-ROM,* Strange Cities CD-ROM,* The Menorah of Fang Bang Lu online documentary, and recently,* Scenes from a Shanghai Hotel digital DVD film, produced in association with the Australian Film Commission.These projects focus on Shanghai as a cultural milieu in film and literature. Interest in working on these projects has evolved from exploring the émigré experience of her Russian grandparents in Shanghai, China. The legacy of her grandfather Serge Ermoll Snr, jazz musical scores and photographs, memorabilia from his orchestra which once played in the dance halls and cabarets of Shanghai, have inspired a journey back to Shanghai as 'melting pot', an idealised space, and place of refuge/ exile for Russians and Europeans following the second world war.

I was surprised by this, as I tend to think of my slice of LA as a fairly quiet one.  I then began to listen with more care, and sounds I had grown accustomed to came gradually into focus: traffic moving along a nearby busy street, an occasional siren or helicopter, even the howls of the coyotes camped out by the reservoir.

In many ways, The Roaring 'Twenties serves as an extension of Thompson's groundbreaking 2002 book, The Soundscape of Modernity: Architectural Acoustics and the Culture of Listening in America, 1900-1933, but this piece extends that earlier work into new sensory registers and toward new audiences.  The project proceeds from a deeply archival impulse.  It richly draws from the Municipal Archives of the City of New York, cataloging over 600 unique complaints about noise around 1930 while reproducing over 350 pages of these materials.  It also includes fifty-four excerpts of Fox Movietone newsreels, early sound experiments that at once captured and technologically remediated the sounds of New York City, as well as hundreds of other photographs and print materials.

The pleasures of this database are not about speed and the algorithm but about a slow and deliberate attention.       The visitor to the piece can navigate along three pathways that organize the site's content via the rubrics of space, time, and sound, each offering a unique vantage point on the database that drives the project.  When navigating the spatial pathway, the user can zoom into the various boroughs of the city, locating historical noise complaints throughout the fabric of the metropolitan region.  When doing so, the vintage facade of the site is sometimes ruptured, allowing the twenty-first-century styling of Google Maps to burst momentarily onto screen.  Similarly, the multi-hued Google logo sits brightly in the lower left corner of the map.  These slight temporal ruptures are useful ones, serving as they do to remind us that access to the past is always mediated through the technologies and inquiries of the present, even as it's quite engaging to dwell in the sounds of years gone by.— Tara McPherson, September 22nd, 2013Reader Responses:The Roaring Twenties site is a wonderful find, an amazing source film & sounds that we've never heard before. If you don't mind, some details about two of your films from a subway historian I know - - the elevated curve was of the 6th Avenue el, perhaps the only sound film of that line. It is looking north up 6th Avenue as a south-bound train rounds the curve to 3rd Street. On the street level is  construction of the IND 6th Avenue subway, for whic the el would be shut down in 1937. - The riding the train film is actualy an IRT subway train on an elevated portion of the subway's route. It is not a wooden car and would be too heavy for the older elevated lines in Manhattan. Thanks again, here hoping there are more films to share! John— John Telesca, November 17th, 2013        \\n\\\\nThe goal is to recover the meaning of sound, to undertake a historicized mode of listening that tunes our modern ears to the pitch of the past.  Simply clicking a 'play\" button will not do.- Emily Thompson, Author's Statement\\n\\nAuthor's StatementMany years ago I published a book about sound and architecture called The Soundscape of Modernity.  The book is a history of the intersection of the evanescent and the concrete.  Throughout its narrative, the ephemeral vibrations of sound interact with a material world intended to control those vibrations.  When I wrote Soundscape, I was interested in historicizing the act of listening as much as the things people heard or the tools they deployed to hear those things.  One of the points I hoped to emphasize was the newness of the idea, as well as the technological reality, of sound separated from the material space in which it was created.  Both the idea and its realization were the fruition of a distinctly modern way of thinking about sound, space, and technology that culminated in the early twentieth century.When the book first appeared in 2002, I was often asked why I didn't issue a companion CD filled with audio recordings of the sounds of the spaces I wrote about, including Symphony Hall in Boston, and St. Thomas's Church and Radio City Music Hall in New York City.  While I hope I always responded politely, in fact, the question kind of annoyed me.  I felt that it missed the whole point of the book, which was to historicize - and thus not to take for granted - the idea that the sound of a specific place could be technologically captured, dislocated from its origins and relocated somewhere else, for example onto a compact disc and hence into any listener's living room (which was primarily where one listened to CD audio recordings way back in 2002).\\tNow, all these years later, I find myself doing the very thing that I resisted when my book was published, but with the benefit of a technology far more powerful than compact discs at transcending the traditional connections between sound and place.  In the past decade, the meaning of space - actual, physical, inhabitable space - has been so fully upended by a culture built upon interconnected technologies of data distribution that the material embodiment of sound etched onto the discrete surface of a compact disc now seems as ancient a relic as the neo-Gothic statuary within St. Thomas's Church.  People today listen to recorded sound anywhere and everywhere, and many engage in modes of listening that not only dissociate the sounds they hear from their places of origin, but also render themselves oblivious to the spaces in which they are physically located while they listen.  The time now seems ripe to deploy these technological tools in a different direction; to use the distribution, organization, and presentation of data to reinvoke a sense of the very specific historical times and physical places in which the sounds of the past were embedded.By offering a website dedicated to the sounds of New York City circa 1930, The Roaring 'Twenties is following the lead of countless other individuals and organizations who have turned the web into a vast sonic archive, delivering a previously unimaginable wealth of historic sound recordings to anyone with a connection and a desire to listen in.  With The Roaring 'Twenties, I hope we not only add to that archive, but also set an example by doing so in an explicitly historically-minded way.  The aim here is not just to present sonic content, but to evoke the original contexts of those sounds, to help us better understand that context as well as the sounds themselves.  The goal is to recover the meaning of sound, to undertake a historicized mode of listening that tunes our modern ears to the pitch of the past.  Simply clicking a \"play\" button will not do.How our website attempts to achieve this goal is outlined more fully in the Introduction built into the site itself.  In this more personal set-up, I want instead to elaborate briefly upon a second goal, one that addresses - perhaps appropriately for a website about listening - the issue of audience.  In constructing The Roaring 'Twenties, we consciously kept multiple audiences in mind and we aimed to speak to a range of different groups through our design.  The audiences we imagined range from the scholarly to the general: from academics currently engaged with investigations in sound studies, sensory history, and urban history; to students of all ages; to members of the general public who perhaps live in, grew up in, or are simply interested in, the neighborhoods of New York.  If we have done our job well and taken full advantage of the generous opportunity that the Vectors' editors provided, the history buff as well as the history professor should find meaning in the site and its content should stimulate personal responses as readily as it does more intellectually objective inquiries.  If our ambitions have exceeded our accomplishments, perhaps the site can serve as a lesson for others, to help them realize more fully the rich potential of the web for public history and sensory history.— Emily Thompson, September 22nd, 2013Reader Responses:\"the material embodiment of sound etched onto the discrete surface of a compact disc now seems as ancient a relic as the neo-Gothic statuary within St. Thomas's Church.\"This is hyperbole. Yes, distribution of physical sound containers of any kind is slowly shrinking, but many millions of compact discs are still being sold worldwide every year. An entire country, Japan, remains wedded to the CD over digital distribution.— Matt, October 10th, 2014        \\n\\\\nOur time machines thus ultimately and necessarily return us to our selves, and the sonic time machine that is The Roaring 'Twenties is no exception.- Emily Thompson, The Roaring 'Twenties\\n\\nDesigner's StatementThis project takes a unique approach to understanding our cultural history, via an exploration of the changing soundscape in New York City circa 1930.  Emily Thompson gathered a rich collection of archival materials for the piece, including over fifty newsreels from the late 1920s, nearly 600 noise complaints, and a collection of related newspaper and magazine articles.   We focused on presenting the materials primarily through a spatial interface. NYC's landscape was quickly being transformed at this time, and that transformation produced an array of new and unique sounds emanating from specific locations. We wanted to plot these locations in an interface that reflected the era, so Emily searched for a map of the city from that period.  She discovered a  6-foot-high, historical map of New York City on eBay.  She had the digital team at Princeton scan the entire map, piece by piece, until it was completely digitized at high resolution. I then took this digitized image and broke it down into 'tiles\" that could be used by the Google maps API. To enable seven different zoom levels within Google maps, we ended up with over 19,000 different tile images that are then reconstructed on the fly as you zoom and navigate spatially within the map interface. The other interfaces take the same archival material and organize them in different ways through sound and time.  The presentation of the materials in these different but related ways allows a more complete picture of the era to be formed and a deeper understanding of it to emerge for the user.As one explores the rich archive contained in this piece, the personal experiences of the characters within begin to come alive - from the passionate pleas expressed in beautifully handwritten letters, to the lengthy exchanges with commissioner Wynne, to the wide array of noises complained about including loud neighbors, \"maniacal laughter . . . enough to drive one mad\", roosters, radios, and the list goes on.  One cannot help but imagine some of the characters energetically penning their complaints.  Or the Bell Labs scientists jutting around NYC in their little \"roving noise laboratory\" truck filled with an \"official measuring apparatus.\"  I can't help but find this image amusing.  As with many modernist attempts to stay ahead of the rapidly changing technological landscape, they go at it with gusto, armed with a bevy of precise scientific tools and methods all intended to somehow control the new technologies, yet still seemingly celebrating their newness at the same time.  As one who sometimes becomes obsessive about whatever my own latest interest happens to be, I can relate and can't help but laugh a little at the recognition of my own occasional over-zealousness.  As you explore the project on your own, I imagine you too may relate to some of the characters within, perhaps to someone penning a noise complaint about traffic, loud construction work, or a neighbor who just won't be quiet.  Good narrative and design allow us to see our own experience reflected back in the experiences of others.  This interactive project hopes to allow such an experience in a unique (and audible) way.— Scott Mahoy, October 25th, 2013        \\n","citation_source_nom":"","citation_source_url":"","date":"2013","perspectives":"","mediums":"","materiaux":"","genres":"","pays":"","collections":"vectors-journal","organisations":"","video":"https://vimeo.com/180025973/8d0e91858b#t=8812s","images":["data/81d5dc89-3eb4-4486-9ee2-ba84c72ec9c0.png"],"preview":"","plateformes":"","tags":"histoire, carte, audio, texte, frise","répertoires":"","technologies":"","description":"Our time machines thus ultimately and necessarily return us to our selves, and the sonic time machine that is The Roaring 'Twenties is no exception.- Emily Thompson, The Roaring 'Twenties\\n\\nEditor's IntroductionA visitor to my home in Los Angeles recently commented on the noisiness of my neighborhood.

Similarly, the multi-hued Google logo sits brightly in the lower left corner of the map.  These slight temporal ruptures are useful ones, serving as they do to remind us that access to the past is always mediated through the technologies and inquiries of the present, even as it's quite engaging to dwell in the sounds of years gone by.— Tara McPherson, September 22nd, 2013Reader Responses:The Roaring Twenties site is a wonderful find, an amazing source film & sounds that we've never heard before. If you don't mind, some details about two of your films from a subway historian I know - - the elevated curve was of the 6th Avenue el, perhaps the only sound film of that line. It is looking north up 6th Avenue as a south-bound train rounds the curve to 3rd Street. On the street level is  construction of the IND 6th Avenue subway, for whic the el would be shut down in 1937. - The riding the train film is actualy an IRT subway train on an elevated portion of the subway's route. It is not a wooden car and would be too heavy for the older elevated lines in Manhattan. Thanks again, here hoping there are more films to share! John— John Telesca, November 17th, 2013        \\n\\\\nThe goal is to recover the meaning of sound, to undertake a historicized mode of listening that tunes our modern ears to the pitch of the past.  Simply clicking a 'play\" button will not do.- Emily Thompson, Author's Statement\\n\\nAuthor's StatementMany years ago I published a book about sound and architecture called The Soundscape of Modernity.  The book is a history of the intersection of the evanescent and the concrete.  Throughout its narrative, the ephemeral vibrations of sound interact with a material world intended to control those vibrations.  When I wrote Soundscape, I was interested in historicizing the act of listening as much as the things people heard or the tools they deployed to hear those things.  One of the points I hoped to emphasize was the newness of the idea, as well as the technological reality, of sound separated from the material space in which it was created.  Both the idea and its realization were the fruition of a distinctly modern way of thinking about sound, space, and technology that culminated in the early twentieth century.When the book first appeared in 2002, I was often asked why I didn't issue a companion CD filled with audio recordings of the sounds of the spaces I wrote about, including Symphony Hall in Boston, and St. Thomas's Church and Radio City Music Hall in New York City.  While I hope I always responded politely, in fact, the question kind of annoyed me.  I felt that it missed the whole point of the book, which was to historicize - and thus not to take for granted - the idea that the sound of a specific place could be technologically captured, dislocated from its origins and relocated somewhere else, for example onto a compact disc and hence into any listener's living room (which was primarily where one listened to CD audio recordings way back in 2002).\\tNow, all these years later, I find myself doing the very thing that I resisted when my book was published, but with the benefit of a technology far more powerful than compact discs at transcending the traditional connections between sound and place.  In the past decade, the meaning of space - actual, physical, inhabitable space - has been so fully upended by a culture built upon interconnected technologies of data distribution that the material embodiment of sound etched onto the discrete surface of a compact disc now seems as ancient a relic as the neo-Gothic statuary within St. Thomas's Church.  People today listen to recorded sound anywhere and everywhere, and many engage in modes of listening that not only dissociate the sounds they hear from their places of origin, but also render themselves oblivious to the spaces in which they are physically located while they listen.  The time now seems ripe to deploy these technological tools in a different direction; to use the distribution, organization, and presentation of data to reinvoke a sense of the very specific historical times and physical places in which the sounds of the past were embedded.By offering a website dedicated to the sounds of New York City circa 1930, The Roaring 'Twenties is following the lead of countless other individuals and organizations who have turned the web into a vast sonic archive, delivering a previously unimaginable wealth of historic sound recordings to anyone with a connection and a desire to listen in.  With The Roaring 'Twenties, I hope we not only add to that archive, but also set an example by doing so in an explicitly historically-minded way.  The aim here is not just to present sonic content, but to evoke the original contexts of those sounds, to help us better understand that context as well as the sounds themselves.  The goal is to recover the meaning of sound, to undertake a historicized mode of listening that tunes our modern ears to the pitch of the past.  Simply clicking a \"play\" button will not do.How our website attempts to achieve this goal is outlined more fully in the Introduction built into the site itself.  In this more personal set-up, I want instead to elaborate briefly upon a second goal, one that addresses - perhaps appropriately for a website about listening - the issue of audience.  In constructing The Roaring 'Twenties, we consciously kept multiple audiences in mind and we aimed to speak to a range of different groups through our design.  The audiences we imagined range from the scholarly to the general: from academics currently engaged with investigations in sound studies, sensory history, and urban history; to students of all ages; to members of the general public who perhaps live in, grew up in, or are simply interested in, the neighborhoods of New York.  If we have done our job well and taken full advantage of the generous opportunity that the Vectors' editors provided, the history buff as well as the history professor should find meaning in the site and its content should stimulate personal responses as readily as it does more intellectually objective inquiries.  If our ambitions have exceeded our accomplishments, perhaps the site can serve as a lesson for others, to help them realize more fully the rich potential of the web for public history and sensory history.— Emily Thompson, September 22nd, 2013Reader Responses:\"the material embodiment of sound etched onto the discrete surface of a compact disc now seems as ancient a relic as the neo-Gothic statuary within St. Thomas's Church.\"This is hyperbole. Yes, distribution of physical sound containers of any kind is slowly shrinking, but many millions of compact discs are still being sold worldwide every year. An entire country, Japan, remains wedded to the CD over digital distribution.— Matt, October 10th, 2014        \\n\\\\nOur time machines thus ultimately and necessarily return us to our selves, and the sonic time machine that is The Roaring 'Twenties is no exception.- Emily Thompson, The Roaring 'Twenties\\n\\nDesigner's StatementThis project takes a unique approach to understanding our cultural history, via an exploration of the changing soundscape in New York City circa 1930.  Emily Thompson gathered a rich collection of archival materials for the piece, including over fifty newsreels from the late 1920s, nearly 600 noise complaints, and a collection of related newspaper and magazine articles.   We focused on presenting the materials primarily through a spatial interface. NYC's landscape was quickly being transformed at this time, and that transformation produced an array of new and unique sounds emanating from specific locations. We wanted to plot these locations in an interface that reflected the era, so Emily searched for a map of the city from that period.  She discovered a  6-foot-high, historical map of New York City on eBay.  She had the digital team at Princeton scan the entire map, piece by piece, until it was completely digitized at high resolution. I then took this digitized image and broke it down into 'tiles\" that could be used by the Google maps API. To enable seven different zoom levels within Google maps, we ended up with over 19,000 different tile images that are then reconstructed on the fly as you zoom and navigate spatially within the map interface. The other interfaces take the same archival material and organize them in different ways through sound and time.  The presentation of the materials in these different but related ways allows a more complete picture of the era to be formed and a deeper understanding of it to emerge for the user.As one explores the rich archive contained in this piece, the personal experiences of the characters within begin to come alive - from the passionate pleas expressed in beautifully handwritten letters, to the lengthy exchanges with commissioner Wynne, to the wide array of noises complained about including loud neighbors, \"maniacal laughter . . . enough to drive one mad\", roosters, radios, and the list goes on.  One cannot help but imagine some of the characters energetically penning their complaints.  Or the Bell Labs scientists jutting around NYC in their little \"roving noise laboratory\" truck filled with an \"official measuring apparatus.\"  I can't help but find this image amusing.  As with many modernist attempts to stay ahead of the rapidly changing technological landscape, they go at it with gusto, armed with a bevy of precise scientific tools and methods all intended to somehow control the new technologies, yet still seemingly celebrating their newness at the same time.  As one who sometimes becomes obsessive about whatever my own latest interest happens to be, I can relate and can't help but laugh a little at the recognition of my own occasional over-zealousness.  As you explore the project on your own, I imagine you too may relate to some of the characters within, perhaps to someone penning a noise complaint about traffic, loud construction work, or a neighbor who just won't be quiet.  Good narrative and design allow us to see our own experience reflected back in the experiences of others.  This interactive project hopes to allow such an experience in a unique (and audible) way.— Scott Mahoy, October 25th, 2013        \\n","collection":"pièces"},{"id":"the-unmaking-of-markets--a-composite-visual-history","url":"http://vectorsjournal.org/projects/index.php?project=5","titre":"The Unmaking of Markets: A Composite Visual History","personnes":"Rebecca Jean Emigh","citation":"\\r\\nEditor's IntroductionThe past is not always prologue.

An anonymous reviewer commented that my print article (Emigh 2003b) was tedious and boring. Yet, audiences of my oral PowerPoint presentations with similar material rarely appeared annoyed or sleepy. From this difference, I concluded that the visual presentation evoked a time and place, helping the audience to imagine an unfamiliar history that the text alone did not. Consequently, I wanted this multimedia piece to extend my PowerPoint visuals by creating an experience of the evidence, the time period, and my substantive argument. I hope the piece successfully accomplishes this goal and, by doing so, creates interest in using the methods and concepts of historical sociology to study time periods before the modern one, as well as creating interest in multimedia scholarship more generally.     Advancing toward this goal depended on a successful collaboration between Erik Loyer and me that combined our technical expertise (my research with his technological skills). However, our shared interest in the ideas—especially that of the composite—were ultimately more important. The more abstract intellectual content made better project glue than the technical details because the latter were initially too unclear to provide much motivation or guidance. Thus, we worked on the design process in a completely iterative way: I had no idea what to write until I saw what Loyer had designed; he often needed to see my text to know what to design. Consequently, we often exchanged text and designs that ordinarily would have been only rough 'notes to ourselves,\" so that we could try to gauge where the other was headed. In this process, Loyer's design has shaped the content and form of my argument just as much as my substantive argument informed the design decisions.

Instantaneous or discontinuous change is avoided in favor of animated forms that smoothly expand and contract along their various axes as they partition space for the user.  Over time, the fetish is revealed for what it is, an entertaining and harmless particularity of taste.  More importantly, we again become open to alternative languages for organizing our work.I found myself drawn to the Unmaking of Markets project both as a personal challenge in that the content of the piece was so far afield from anything I had ever dealt with before, and also because the project seemed to offer a very clear opportunity to see what would happen when traditional academic research allied itself with new media tools and techniques.  Embodiment and performance are very important to me, and they are typically interface characteristics I willingly embrace whenever I have the freedom to do so, usually as a reaction against the immobility of the digital spaces we find ourselves in on a day-to-day basis.  In this project, however, imputing significant motion to every quiver of the mouse felt like shadow boxing with an enemy that hadn't been born yet.Instead, working iteratively, Emigh and I sought to unlearn some of today's conventions and introduce attributes of the period, not to achieve a superficial congruence but instead because those attributes represent composite ways of knowing and seeing that we find echoed in our attempts to find new methods for illustrating evidence.  The two interactive composites featured in the piece are the best example of the fusion of historical influences and new media potentialities we were trying to achieve.  The initial appearance of these composites recalls aspects of the period, both in overall styling and in the specific elements we \"quoted\" from paintings of the day.

Even in these cases, however, we found, as have many before us, that the acceptance of creative limitations focused the work in very useful ways.

The Virtual Window, published by MIT Press just weeks before the launch of the Vectors \"Perception\" issue, offers the opportunity to think deeply about the entangled forces that contribute to the evolution of technologies of vision -- everything from the etymology of key terms in visual culture to the science of glass manufacturing. Along the way, Friedberg seeks to theorize and historicize vision itself through a variety of critical \"lenses,\" each of which operates in conjunction with certain technologies at specific moments in time.

A genuinely eclectic range of primary source material places Stephen Colbert's \"Green Screen Challenge\" on a continuum that includes both Hitchcock and Rembrandt; and there is nothing to prevent a user from viewing a cinemascope film within the aperture of a video iPod, or watching excerpts from I Love Lucy in the frame of a Renaissance era stained glass window. It is in the nature of interactive projects that you can never really be sure that you have read every word and seen every image. This is especially true of The Virtual Window Interactive, which requires patience and experimentation in order to experience it fully. Certain elements of Friedberg's text only become available in conjunction with particular combinations of aperture and content, for example, so an assiduous user might discover new elements upon repeated excursions into the project. In addition, many of the media examples in the interactive version are not addressed in the published text, and the project's database structure allows for the possibility of future addition, updating and revision. This mutability and expansiveness is arguably one of the most powerful aspects of digital publishing, and Vectors is fortunate that Friedberg was willing to risk having her scholarship subjected to potentially playful as well as serious interrogation. What Friedberg and Loyer achieve with the Virtual Window interactive is a mode of scholarly practice that is experiential, remixable and fluid, perhaps ultimately in ways that exceed the intentions of its creators.— Vectors Journal Editorial Staff\"As we spend more of our time staring into the frames of movies, television, computers, hand-held displays -- \"windows\" full of moving images, text, icons, and 3D graphics -- how the world is framed may be as important as what is contained within that frame.\"\\\\n\\n\\t\\n\\tThe Virtual Window Interactive\\n\\t\\nBy Anne Friedberg\\nDesign by Erik LoyerAuthor's StatementThis project is a translation/extension/conversion of ideas and arguments from my book, The Virtual Window: From Alberti to Microsoft (Cambridge, MA: The MIT Press, 2006). The book was written and thought in the midst of the hyperspeed of technological change. I was writing about the screen on a screen; I was writing a book about windows, their virtual substitutes, and the fractured multiplicity of the multiple 'windowed\" screen; I was writing while looking into a screen fractured into many windows - overlapping and simultaneous applications, some hermetically-sealed, some wired to the outside. Because the computer screen is both a \"page\" and a \"window,\" at once opaque and transparent, it commands a new posture for the practice of writing and reading - one that requires looking into the page as if it is the frame of a window. I knew that I would need to translate the book to an environment that would allow me link its concepts with its form. The Virtual Window Interactive is the book's digital \"Other.\" It forms a tangent to the matrix of concepts in the book while supplying vivid examples of the still and moving images that have - in the span of centuries - filled the apertures of our windows, frames, and screens. The ideas for The Virtual Window Interactive were formed in a series of meetings with colleagues invited to \"think tank\" the project (Anne Balsamo, Perry Hoberman, Steve Anderson) and later in weekly meetings with designer/programmer Erik Loyer and consultant/colleague Steve Anderson. The Virtual Window Interactive was a fully collaborative venture - it would not have taken the form that it has taken without Erik Loyer's skilled sensibility as designer/programmer.— Anne Friedberg\\\\n\\n\\t\\n\\tThe Virtual Window Interactive\\n\\t\\nBy Anne Friedberg\\nDesign by Erik LoyerDesigner's StatementAnne Friedberg, Steve Anderson and I ran into an interesting quandary as the design of this project was underway.  Once we had settled upon creating a kind of 'playset\" in which users could experiment with combining elements of a variety of window-mediated viewing experiences, our attention turned to exactly which elements the user would be able to combine.  Instinctively, it seemed correct to separate content from dimension and dimension from form, so that it would be possible, for example, to take the image content from a silent film and slip it into a stained glass window, or to apply a Cinemascope aspect ratio to a portrait set in the frame of a digital TV. The technique I came up with for handling the various visual presentations included a \"frame\" image that included the borders of the screen or window being shown, a mask that fixed the dimensions of the visual content to a particular shape and aspect ratio, and the visual content itself, whether still or moving. Of course, some of the formats we included, like cinema or painting, were quite forgiving of aspect ratio changes, as their rectangular borders could be easily stretched and sized while still remaining recognizable.  Other formats, like the French window or mobile phone, would quickly reveal the digital artifice of the endeavor if stretched to fit uncommon dimensions.We struggled for a while over how to address this issue, knowing that simply distorting our framing imagery to fit any possible aspect ratio would look silly, but not wanting to close off options for the user.  After all, even combinations that might appear ridiculous could ultimately contribute to driving home the point of the piece's interactivity: to allow the user to enact the fluidity of the concept of \"window\" as it has manifested itself across eras.In the case of the mobile phone, I tried to preserve those options for the user by designing a \"generic mobile device\" setting that would admit some degree of stretching and sizing, while still appearing to be hand-held.  The idea was to simply put a giant silhouette of a hand behind the image content, thereby giving the proper sense of scale without attempting to render a particular device.  The attempt failed miserably; the image didn't relate to the hand in any understandable way, and neither had anything to do with to any mobile device experience now extant.  Frustrated, I ended up scanning my hand holding my own cell phone and using that as the basis for the image.  The result was much more compelling; the image captured the nuances of the contact between palm and device, the specificity of which immediately put to rest any thought of stretching the image to accommodate multiple aspect ratios.  While such play would have boasted of the malleability of the digital, it would also have betrayed the grounding in physicality that is so critical to Anne's argument. Tracing the historical incarnations of the window from physical to digital is on the one hand an exercise in conceptual fluidity, but perhaps more important is the way in Anne's work celebrates the specific, painstaking design of visual experience as it has evolved over time.— Erik Loyer","citation_source_nom":"","citation_source_url":"","date":"2007","perspectives":"","mediums":"","materiaux":"","genres":"","pays":"","collections":"vectors-journal","organisations":"","video":"https://vimeo.com/180025973/8d0e91858b#t=5186s","images":["data/4e86aedb-10dc-480c-9143-c9ccbebfc615.png"],"preview":"","plateformes":"","tags":"histoire de l'art, dessin, texte, reproductions image","répertoires":"","technologies":"","description":"\\n\\t\\n\\tThe Virtual Window Interactive\\n\\t\\nBy Anne Friedberg\\nDesign by Erik LoyerEditor's Introduction'As we spend more of our time staring into the frames of movies, television, computers, hand-held displays -- \"windows\" full of moving images, text, icons, and 3D graphics -- how the world is framed may be as important as what is contained within that frame.\" This opening declaration in Anne Friedberg's new book The Virtual Window: From Alberti to Microsoft, offers a glimpse of what is at stake in her expansive survey of visual culture over the past 500 years.

This is especially true of The Virtual Window Interactive, which requires patience and experimentation in order to experience it fully. Certain elements of Friedberg's text only become available in conjunction with particular combinations of aperture and content, for example, so an assiduous user might discover new elements upon repeated excursions into the project. In addition, many of the media examples in the interactive version are not addressed in the published text, and the project's database structure allows for the possibility of future addition, updating and revision. This mutability and expansiveness is arguably one of the most powerful aspects of digital publishing, and Vectors is fortunate that Friedberg was willing to risk having her scholarship subjected to potentially playful as well as serious interrogation. What Friedberg and Loyer achieve with the Virtual Window interactive is a mode of scholarly practice that is experiential, remixable and fluid, perhaps ultimately in ways that exceed the intentions of its creators.— Vectors Journal Editorial Staff\"As we spend more of our time staring into the frames of movies, television, computers, hand-held displays -- \"windows\" full of moving images, text, icons, and 3D graphics -- how the world is framed may be as important as what is contained within that frame.\"\\\\n\\n\\t\\n\\tThe Virtual Window Interactive\\n\\t\\nBy Anne Friedberg\\nDesign by Erik LoyerAuthor's StatementThis project is a translation/extension/conversion of ideas and arguments from my book, The Virtual Window: From Alberti to Microsoft (Cambridge, MA: The MIT Press, 2006). The book was written and thought in the midst of the hyperspeed of technological change. I was writing about the screen on a screen; I was writing a book about windows, their virtual substitutes, and the fractured multiplicity of the multiple 'windowed\" screen; I was writing while looking into a screen fractured into many windows - overlapping and simultaneous applications, some hermetically-sealed, some wired to the outside. Because the computer screen is both a \"page\" and a \"window,\" at once opaque and transparent, it commands a new posture for the practice of writing and reading - one that requires looking into the page as if it is the frame of a window. I knew that I would need to translate the book to an environment that would allow me link its concepts with its form. The Virtual Window Interactive is the book's digital \"Other.\" It forms a tangent to the matrix of concepts in the book while supplying vivid examples of the still and moving images that have - in the span of centuries - filled the apertures of our windows, frames, and screens. The ideas for The Virtual Window Interactive were formed in a series of meetings with colleagues invited to \"think tank\" the project (Anne Balsamo, Perry Hoberman, Steve Anderson) and later in weekly meetings with designer/programmer Erik Loyer and consultant/colleague Steve Anderson. The Virtual Window Interactive was a fully collaborative venture - it would not have taken the form that it has taken without Erik Loyer's skilled sensibility as designer/programmer.— Anne Friedberg\\\\n\\n\\t\\n\\tThe Virtual Window Interactive\\n\\t\\nBy Anne Friedberg\\nDesign by Erik LoyerDesigner's StatementAnne Friedberg, Steve Anderson and I ran into an interesting quandary as the design of this project was underway.  Once we had settled upon creating a kind of 'playset\" in which users could experiment with combining elements of a variety of window-mediated viewing experiences, our attention turned to exactly which elements the user would be able to combine.  Instinctively, it seemed correct to separate content from dimension and dimension from form, so that it would be possible, for example, to take the image content from a silent film and slip it into a stained glass window, or to apply a Cinemascope aspect ratio to a portrait set in the frame of a digital TV. The technique I came up with for handling the various visual presentations included a \"frame\" image that included the borders of the screen or window being shown, a mask that fixed the dimensions of the visual content to a particular shape and aspect ratio, and the visual content itself, whether still or moving. Of course, some of the formats we included, like cinema or painting, were quite forgiving of aspect ratio changes, as their rectangular borders could be easily stretched and sized while still remaining recognizable.  Other formats, like the French window or mobile phone, would quickly reveal the digital artifice of the endeavor if stretched to fit uncommon dimensions.We struggled for a while over how to address this issue, knowing that simply distorting our framing imagery to fit any possible aspect ratio would look silly, but not wanting to close off options for the user.  After all, even combinations that might appear ridiculous could ultimately contribute to driving home the point of the piece's interactivity: to allow the user to enact the fluidity of the concept of \"window\" as it has manifested itself across eras.In the case of the mobile phone, I tried to preserve those options for the user by designing a \"generic mobile device\" setting that would admit some degree of stretching and sizing, while still appearing to be hand-held.  The idea was to simply put a giant silhouette of a hand behind the image content, thereby giving the proper sense of scale without attempting to render a particular device.  The attempt failed miserably; the image didn't relate to the hand in any understandable way, and neither had anything to do with to any mobile device experience now extant.  Frustrated, I ended up scanning my hand holding my own cell phone and using that as the basis for the image.  The result was much more compelling; the image captured the nuances of the contact between palm and device, the specificity of which immediately put to rest any thought of stretching the image to accommodate multiple aspect ratios.  While such play would have boasted of the malleability of the digital, it would also have betrayed the grounding in physicality that is so critical to Anne's argument. Tracing the historical incarnations of the window from physical to digital is on the one hand an exercise in conceptual fluidity, but perhaps more important is the way in Anne's work celebrates the specific, painstaking design of visual experience as it has evolved over time.— Erik Loyer","collection":"pièces"},{"id":"thoughtmesh--tag-your-writing--join-the-conversation-","url":"http://vectorsjournal.org/projects/index.php?project=84","titre":"ThoughtMesh: Tag your writing.

We, as users, should become smarter as a result, but more importantly, the system itself should grow more intelligent as it is used, annotated, tagged and (re)organized by a motivated and informed user base. But significant obstacles to achieving the dream of a genuinely intelligent, self-organizing, or semantic network remain. Some applications yield content that the network cannot see as anything other than a black box with unknown contents; others may be visible but with a degree of granularity that is either too large or too small -- having Google read every word of every article and book every time you enter a search term just might not yield the most useful results. Enter Thoughtmesh. This project, created as a collaboration between Jon Ippolito and Craig Dietrich, aims to facilitate the intelligent parsing and tagging of the content of academic articles hosted either externally on the net at large or internally on the Thoughtmesh server. The system then generates connections via tag clouds of the contents of all articles tagged using Thoughtmesh protocols. Like all metadata schemes, Thoughtmesh is only as useful as its community of users makes it and its power grows exponentially as more users begin to see its value and feed their own content into the system. Each issue of Vectors features at least one such 'tool to think with,\" which invites contributions and functionality beyond the bounds of a one-time publication. Part of the promise of Thoughtmesh is its appeal to clearly defined constituencies within the academic community. And while certain sectors of academia -- particularly in the humanities -- continue to struggle to see the value of online publication, Thoughtmesh offers to amplify the value of electronic publication by making it not only more timely, cost-effective and widely distributed, but also more intelligent, dynamic and contributing to a more vibrant cultural discourse.— Vectors Journal Editorial Staff\\\\n\\n\\t\\n\\tThoughtMesh\\n\\tTag your writing.

Distribute and Connect!ThoughtMesh is an argument for changing the way scholars publish their research. ThoughtMesh is also a tool. If you're one of those people who learn more from doing than from reading, then check out this tool right now. (Go ahead, while no one is looking.)Otherwise read on to find out what I think is wrong with existing publication mechanisms, and why I think ThoughtMesh is a step in the right direction.1. The Problem: Where Do New Media Academics Publish?It's no secret that today's academics are having trouble keeping up with networked media. The currency of academia remains the peer-reviewed print journal—not exactly the ideal medium for intellectual discourse in the fast-paced age of the Internet. The archaic criteria by which most universities award promotion and tenure mean that even academics who specialize in digital culture find it hard to justify writing about it in a digital vernacular. But if scholars don't want to drift ever further out of touch with the information Twittering and Flickring across the world's browsers and cell phones, they'd better find a way to tap into and redirect these information flows.Unfortunately, it's one thing for the American Council of Learned Societies and Modern Language Association to urge academics to explore digital scholarship, and another for academics to get it right. Most professors stop at PowerPoint, which is a bit like aiming for the Olympics and stopping at Pee Wee baseball. Of course, whenever I rant in public about PowerPoint's unconnected, unnavigable, and profoundly anti-social interface, some 50-something guy in a tweed jacket invariably asks me what to use in its stead. Usually I recommend learning some HTML or JavaScript, at which point Mr. Professorial's eyes glaze over and I realize I've shifted into a language he doesn't speak.Sure, there are off-the-shelf HTML cookiecutters like FrontPage and Dreamweaver, though they can be a little intimidating to a writer raised on an IBM Selectric. Blogs are easier and offer nifty networking tools like syndication and trackback, but their diaristic format doesn't lend itself to lengthy analyses. If you're really lucky, your department will hire an ace Web developer to HTMLify your research—but even then your pretty online essays are likely to end up marooned on the island of your university's Web site, semantically isolated from the rest of the Web.In fact, none of these formats makes it easy to find online scholarship. What are the chances that the Tufts professor you met at a conference on Postimpressionism is going to stumble upon that kick-ass Cézanne paper on your Web site? Googling the phrase 'nude bathers\" certainly isn't going to help. When forced to compete with porn, paparazzi, and politics, the average scholarly Web page falls too low on the food chain of commercial search engines to be discovered by another researcher. And with the Semantic Web at least five years off—with many saying it will never get here at all—sleuthing out networked scholarship means shadowing a dubious trail of desultory hyperlinks or piecing through disconnected search returns from siloed databases.Of course, Vectors projects offer scholars an ideal solution. Who wouldn't want their paper semantically tethered to other Vectors essays, with an interface tailormade to the subject matter by a dream team of Flash designers? Sadly, Vectors Fellowships are available only to a half dozen Fellowship winners per year. So what's a new media scholar to do?2. A Solution: ThoughtMesh When Craig Dietrich and I set out to build ThoughtMesh, we asked ourselves how an ideal publishing tool for scholars would behave. We decided that we wanted a system that was distributed—not siloed away in a single database, but able to be published on any Web site anywhere. We also wanted all the essays to be connected to each other, by something less random than search returns, but more serendipitous than intentional hyperlinks.To accomplish these ends, we built ThoughtMesh to:* Allow navigation by tags as well as essay sections.Tag clouds are new organizational structures emerging in today's distributed publication communities, most famously in popular social networking sites like del.icio.us, Technorati, and Flickr. In a typical tag cloud, clickable words corresponding to user-defined categories mill or float about on a page, their position and prominence determined by an emergent count of the number of times they have been used rather than by some top-down authorial decision. Clouds allow for overlapping, not dichotomous categories. They visualize relevance as a swarming or bubbling rather than a roll-call or rank.* Allow dynamic re-organization. Clicking on a tag should reveal a substructure of relevant points—a particular slice through the essay—without leaving the essay behind.  And readers should be able to choose topics from a single tag (Cézanne) or from combinations of them (Cézanne + nude + bathers).* Pull in related texts dynamically.Thanks to John Bell's Telamon software, within the essay interface readers should be able to skim a stream of similarly tagged articles created with the same tool, whether they are hosted on Vectors or Geocities. Unlike  a typical database search, the tool should fetch thematically related excerpts or articles without requiring a page refresh.* Let authors choose automatic or manual transmission. An ideal system would let fastidious authors set their own tags for each section, while authors pressed for time could let ThoughtMesh auto-generate their tags based on the most frequently used words in the essay.* Encourage live conversation. A presenter using this tool should be able to skip around from one topic to another outside of a pre-ordained order, so as to respond better to live conversation and feedback from others in the room. (Want to see a PowerPoint presenter squirm? Ask her to go back to a slide in the middle of the stack.) And make the tool browser-based, so if anyone asks a question the presenter doesn't know, she can Wikipedia it in another tab!* Be easy to use. The must successful Web 2.0 applications (Flickr, del.icio.us, Basecamp) have clean, easy to use interfaces. Inside of fifteen minutes, authors should be able to copy-paste a bunch of paragraphs and watch a navigable cloud of tags emerge.* Operate in standalone or networked fashion.One week you're presenting on a laptop in an igloo in Nunavut; the next you're at MIT, where even the bathrooms have WiFi. Either way, the tool should let you strut your stuff—it should be easily networked but not require a network connection.* Be easily shared with others. The tool should be lightweight to download and easy to host on your own domain. For maximum reusability, the application should be open source and ideally able to run without a compiler.3. A Meshed FutureCraig and I have designed ThoughtMesh to accommodate as many of these features as possible, but we have more goals for future releases. In approximate order of completion, these include:* Mesh more essays.ThoughtMesh needs a critical mass of essays for its tagging system to generate results; it's nice to see all sections of the current essay tagged with Cézanne, but nicer to see some other essays in the mesh tagged with that term. Fortunately, the generous folks at the Vectors program have agreed to seed the mesh with the articles from past issues of Vectors, which will provide a wide-ranging initial pool of insightful and polished essays.* Enable multiple meshes. Adding hundreds of essays to ThoughtMesh could introduce noise in the signal—how do you know that article tagged with Cézanne isn't really a Viagra ad?—but Craig and I have a couple plans for offsetting this tendency. One solution is to enable community-based \"meshes\" that authors can create and control. So if you're in charge of the \"Victorian Literary Criticism\" mesh, you can decide what's in and what's out. Each reader can then choose to view 1) only related sections from a particular mesh/es, or 2) related sections from the entire system (all meshes).* Article rating and smart sortingArticle ratings offer another way to boost the signal-to-noise ratio. Fortunately, Still Water Research Fellow John Bell has been at work on a prototype for a distributed commentary and evaluation system, called RePoste, that would dovetail perfectly with ThoughtMesh. In a future release, a RePoste-driven mixing agent might also reconfigure the position of each essay excerpt returned by the mesh. This would prevent the circular \"rich get richer\" bias of many interfaces, whereby the most-frequently cited essay is most read because it is the most frequently cited.* Single-field essay input. To make it even easier to mesh an essay, an alternative version of the input page might allow authors to paste an entire, unseparated text and add wiki-like markup instead of having to cut and paste text sections separately.* Mesh tracing.A longer-term goal is to offer readers an interactive map showing how tags connect articles in a given mesh. This is more than eye candy; as I've argued elsewhere, clouds of influence are a much more nuanced way to recognize achievement in academic networks than journal \"impact factors.\" Giving an essay's connections visual form could help evaluators understand the Big Picture of that author's influence within an academic subculture and the broader online community.Craig and I are always looking for ways to improve ThoughtMesh, so please email us at TK if you have any questions or suggestions. In the end, we hope ThoughtMesh's paradigm of distributed connection will prevail as much by enactment as by argument. That, after all, is the new media way.August 2007— Jon Ippolito\\\\n\\n\\t\\n\\tThoughtMesh\\n\\tTag your writing. Join the conversation.\\n\\t\\nBy Jon Ippolito & Craig Dietrich\\nDesigner's Statement: Taking the Web with YouWeb developers, I think, sometimes feel that the world is going to disappear.  Maybe not the actual world, but working in a landscape of software code, servers, and Internet connections that come and go, we see online projects, documents, and other various forms of information go up and come down, never to be seen again.  The temporal nature of the Web is due to the placement of all material on an abstracted machine in another part of the country.  And, unless certain technologically intensive steps are taken, a user would find it very difficult to 'take a Web site with you\" once disconnected from the Internet.The inability to get hold of a Web project stems in part from the necessary security restrictions involved with such a public arena as the Web, and also specialized, exceptionally efficient portable databases (such as MySQL).  Unlike Microsoft Excel—or Eudora email, another type of database—MySQL lives on the server and is only accessible via the actions of the developer.  Excel provides a powerful desktop application to interact with data, while MySQL lives on a server, only to reach the user through the Web project being viewed.Certainly, Web developers aren't the only ones feeling timid about the current state of the Web.  Placing content online seems necessarily to involve losing your rights to the display, peripheral and linking information, even editorial control.  And, if the server is taken offline, the record is completely lost. Finding the online document can also be problematic.  The sheer power of online search engines can also be a downfall; search results in many popular subjects are already fully formed.  Ranking on the first few pages of a search result can be next to impossible for a researcher's material.  There are other options including online \"warehouses\" of scholarly material, yet with seemingly everyone talking about the \"semantic Web\"—the world linked by emergent rather than literal connections—the search bars on popular scholarly sites fall short of delivering a way to search out content based on theme, mood, feeling, or other non-literal means.However, there of course needs to be documents and projects online.  The levels of exposure are limitless, and the new connections formed are critical to scholarship.  ThoughtMesh takes advantage of the Internet by mapping semantic tags to link documents to each other, a feature that is preserved when a Mesh is downloaded to your computer or own server.  ThoughtMesh provides the opportunity to find other documents through semantic links, not literal string matches.   Furthermore, the tag-based linking does not block my control of the document: I can re-publish and re-tag the document online, or, downloading the document, I may still access other documents if on a live Internet connection.Jon Ippolito's work researching new access paradigms is raising questions about the current state of relational information on the Internet, and ThoughtMesh is a practice-based avenue to explore answers.  Downloading the ThoughtMesh files to my laptop, disconnecting the Internet connection, and moments later displaying the Meshed document to colleagues is intriguing.  Through ThoughtMesh's many points of access ranging from placing documents online, semantic tagging, download features, and (soon) the ability to create one's own Mesh network, this project begins to alleviate the temporary feeling I have been living with for some time.

ThoughtMesh provides the opportunity to find other documents through semantic links, not literal string matches.   Furthermore, the tag-based linking does not block my control of the document: I can re-publish and re-tag the document online, or, downloading the document, I may still access other documents if on a live Internet connection.Jon Ippolito's work researching new access paradigms is raising questions about the current state of relational information on the Internet, and ThoughtMesh is a practice-based avenue to explore answers.  Downloading the ThoughtMesh files to my laptop, disconnecting the Internet connection, and moments later displaying the Meshed document to colleagues is intriguing.  Through ThoughtMesh's many points of access ranging from placing documents online, semantic tagging, download features, and (soon) the ability to create one's own Mesh network, this project begins to alleviate the temporary feeling I have been living with for some time.

Faden\\nAuthor's StatementBACKGROUNDWolfgang Schivelbusch's book The Railway Journey inspired this project; In this intellectual history of the railroad's invention, Schivelbusch traces how rail travel radically changed our perception of space and time in the 19th century.As a film studies scholar, I was interested in how the railroad's reconfiguration of human perception neatly segued with the temporal and spatial possibilities introduced by cinema's invention in the late 19th century. Indeed, the perceptual changes suggested by Schivelbusch -- the ability to 'instantaneously\" travel between distant locations, the shrinking and expanding of scale and space, the standardization of time, direct experience replaced by virtual experiences -- all see their fulfillment in early cinema.Yet, Schivelbusch's book remains abstract largely because he discusses perceptual changes via a literary medium. My idea with Tracking Theory was to provide a visual, scholarly \"illustration\" of Schivelbusch's ideas through the medium of film and video. In short, what would the ideas behind The Railway Journey look like as a film instead of a book? What possibilities emerge in visual scholarship?Christian Keathley of Middlebury College provided me the forum to experiment with the above questions when he organized a panel for the 2006 Society for Cinema and Media Studies conference in Vancouver. The panel topic was \"The Video Essay\" and the panelists (Keathley, myself, Michael Jarrett from Pennsylvania State University York, and University of Pennsylvania's Timothy Corrigan) created  short sample films that imagined film studies scholarship as a visual medium.Tracking Theory was my response.APPROACHWith a time limit of 10-13 minutes, I set two major goals for this work. First, I wanted to obviously suggest some visual corollaries to Schivelbusch's work. Second, I wanted to explore the possibilities suggested by \"the essay\" and early cinema. Given early cinema's diversity of genres and approaches (freely mixing narrative, spectacle, actuality, and fiction), my film's subject matter seemed to neatly fit with the essayistic form.I also liked the video essay's refiguring of artist and audience relationship. While the idea of \"interactive\" media has been much hyped in recent years, it seems to me the \"essay\" film has long existed as an interactive form. Unlike traditional Hollywood narrative and its more homogenous, disposable, and formulaic approach, the essay film intentionally invites the audience to probe, re-view, and question the film's content and style. For me, much of today's interactive media design requires interactivity of hands and mouse but not necessarily the brain.

Never mind that the list also includes \"yodeling\" \"tushology\" and \"digital maoism,\" when the NYT shows up with a six-pack under its arm, the party is probably nearly over anyway. Trevor Paglen didn't invent the idea of reversing the gaze of the cultural panopticon, but he has been doing it with extraordinary virtuosity for nearly ten years. Legend has it that Paglen, who has been called the Fox Mulder of cultural geography, was personally instrumental in provoking the military to extend the perimeter around Area 51 by several miles in an attempt to thwart one of his counter-surveillance efforts, which he dubs \"limit telephotography.\" Basically, Paglen leads tours around the edges of the military industrial complex, and true to his training as a geographer, maps the contours and the surfaces that conceal as much as they give away. Even black-world operations, the government's double-secret programs that take place largely in remote deserts and mountains, involve people and objects such as planes. And just as people and objects obey certain basic laws of physics (such as having mass and taking up space), they can be tracked using tools that are variously high and low tech ”\" from high-power telephoto lenses to FAA flight-tracking data. Unmarked Planes and Hidden Geographies has it all. Fuzzy counter-surveillance photos taken from miles away sit side-by-side with crisply rendered map tracking data that shows the routes taken by planes with blocked tail numbers and no official destinations. Paglen's work deftly limns the boundaries between art and scholarship while also suggesting a provocative conjunction of politics and tourism. His unassuming prose requires visitors to read between the lines in order to generate their own interpretations and conclusions. Even if the truth is out there, Paglen's work argues implicitly, finding answers is not an easy task. As access to unalloyed truth seems increasingly to occupy an elusive position on an infinitely receding horizon, Paglen's rare type of work becomes ever more important. A responsible citizenry may no longer rely (if indeed it ever could) on official pronouncements from corporate and governmental press offices. Instead, those who wish to educate themselves about the world must function as detectives or journalists, following threads and triangulating sources. Paglen's work is exemplary for its insistent look at some of the things we may least want to admit about our government. And his method is ultimately pedagogical, proferring more questions than answers, along with hints about how to uncover the truth for ourselves, if only we have the nerve to do so.— Vectors Journal Editorial Staff\\\\n\\n\\t\\n\\tUnmarked Planes and Hidden Geographies\\n\\t\\nBy Trevor Paglen\\nDesign by Craig Dietrich & Raegan KellyAuthor's StatementYou can learn a lot about geography by tracking the movements of airplanes. Open up the in-flight magazine on any airplane and you'll see what I mean. Within the glossy pages of those magazines, you'll inevitably find maps of the world with lines connecting cities to one another ”' these are of course routes flown by the airline whose plane you're sitting in. But they represent something more than that. Aircraft flights and routes help visualize a form of what geographers call \"relational space\": the often hidden ways in which non-contiguous spaces are in fact profoundly interwoven. London is intensely connected to New York to Los Angles to Tokyo”¦ one the other hand, how many lines connect to Kinshasa? Ashgabat? Kabul? These absences represent a different kind of relational space.But there are many, many kinds of aircraft besides the cramped, coach-class commercial planes that many of us are accustomed to. There are the private executive jets of the extremely rich; the light prop planes of recreational pilots; the cargo fleets of UPS, Federal Express, DHL and the like; the helicopters and light planes of police departments; need I go on?; then there is, of course, the military. And within the military ”\" which sometimes seems like a world unto itself - there are also scores of different aircraft types: cargo planes, fighters, bombers, trainers, transports, spy planes. Just as the movements of commercial aircraft describe various kinds of relational space, so do the movements of military aircraft.This project is about one very peculiar subset of military aircraft ”\" a fleet of nondescript Boeing 737s and Beechcraft King Airs that use the call-sign JANET when they're operating in civilian airspace. The JANETs are an airline operating in the service of the military whose purpose is to shuttle workers to and from a collection of secret military installations in the Southwest and to undertake support operations for some of the most obscure activities within the Military Industrial Complex. The JANETs' movements represent a very peculiar kind of relational space indeed ”\" a geography of secret projects, places, and people that military and defense-industry insiders refer to as the \"black world.\"To develop this project, we've taken advantage of an unlikely contradiction in the way that this fleet of aircraft is set up. Because the JANET fleet operates under the guise of a civilian (rather than military) organization, the fleet has to obey the conventions of civilian aviation. These conventions include filing plans with the Federal Aviation Administration for each flight, and updating large files of maintenance records and registration histories with the FAA. For good reasons, these sorts of documents fall squarely in the public domain. Flight data from the JANETs, for example, is available in near-real time. To build this project, we've taken advantage of these public data sources in order to build an application that maps ”\" in close to real time ”\" the production and reproduction of the \"black world's\" secret geographies.— Trevor Paglen\\\\n\\n\\t\\n\\tUnmarked Planes and Hidden Geographies\\n\\t\\nBy Trevor Paglen\\nDesign by Craig Dietrich & Raegan KellyDesigner's StatementThe cornerstone of Unmarked Planes and Hidden Geographies is a dynamically generated map of the southwestern United States. Data collected is filtered according to predetermined fleets and each plane's flight activity from a fixed set of bases. The map engine, which started filtering data July of 2006, has produced some interesting patterns--vector logs of JANETs operating in and out of some of the large and smaller regional public airports we use. The airborne 'black world\" is clearly not restricted to the confines of secret military facilities, and can be made visible to those who know where to look.Early development research was inspired by \"Trip Mapping with PHP\" by David Sklar, author of PHP Cookbook. He outlines the necessary algorithms for converting longitude/latitude coordinates to pixels to write route lines on a map image. Unmarked Planes and Hidden Geographies expanded on these operations as we anticipated \"black world\" flight paths to North/South and East/West hemispheres, which are not supported in the original mathematical outlines.  While pixels start at (0,0) in the lower left of an image and increase into infinity to the upper right, coordinates originate from 0 in the 'middle', at Greenwich, England, and the equator, with corresponding plus and minus values.

Never mind that the list also includes \"yodeling\" \"tushology\" and \"digital maoism,\" when the NYT shows up with a six-pack under its arm, the party is probably nearly over anyway. Trevor Paglen didn't invent the idea of reversing the gaze of the cultural panopticon, but he has been doing it with extraordinary virtuosity for nearly ten years. Legend has it that Paglen, who has been called the Fox Mulder of cultural geography, was personally instrumental in provoking the military to extend the perimeter around Area 51 by several miles in an attempt to thwart one of his counter-surveillance efforts, which he dubs \"limit telephotography.\" Basically, Paglen leads tours around the edges of the military industrial complex, and true to his training as a geographer, maps the contours and the surfaces that conceal as much as they give away. Even black-world operations, the government's double-secret programs that take place largely in remote deserts and mountains, involve people and objects such as planes. And just as people and objects obey certain basic laws of physics (such as having mass and taking up space), they can be tracked using tools that are variously high and low tech ”\" from high-power telephoto lenses to FAA flight-tracking data. Unmarked Planes and Hidden Geographies has it all. Fuzzy counter-surveillance photos taken from miles away sit side-by-side with crisply rendered map tracking data that shows the routes taken by planes with blocked tail numbers and no official destinations. Paglen's work deftly limns the boundaries between art and scholarship while also suggesting a provocative conjunction of politics and tourism. His unassuming prose requires visitors to read between the lines in order to generate their own interpretations and conclusions. Even if the truth is out there, Paglen's work argues implicitly, finding answers is not an easy task. As access to unalloyed truth seems increasingly to occupy an elusive position on an infinitely receding horizon, Paglen's rare type of work becomes ever more important. A responsible citizenry may no longer rely (if indeed it ever could) on official pronouncements from corporate and governmental press offices. Instead, those who wish to educate themselves about the world must function as detectives or journalists, following threads and triangulating sources. Paglen's work is exemplary for its insistent look at some of the things we may least want to admit about our government. And his method is ultimately pedagogical, proferring more questions than answers, along with hints about how to uncover the truth for ourselves, if only we have the nerve to do so.— Vectors Journal Editorial Staff\\\\n\\n\\t\\n\\tUnmarked Planes and Hidden Geographies\\n\\t\\nBy Trevor Paglen\\nDesign by Craig Dietrich & Raegan KellyAuthor's StatementYou can learn a lot about geography by tracking the movements of airplanes. Open up the in-flight magazine on any airplane and you'll see what I mean. Within the glossy pages of those magazines, you'll inevitably find maps of the world with lines connecting cities to one another ”' these are of course routes flown by the airline whose plane you're sitting in. But they represent something more than that. Aircraft flights and routes help visualize a form of what geographers call \"relational space\": the often hidden ways in which non-contiguous spaces are in fact profoundly interwoven. London is intensely connected to New York to Los Angles to Tokyo”¦ one the other hand, how many lines connect to Kinshasa? Ashgabat? Kabul? These absences represent a different kind of relational space.But there are many, many kinds of aircraft besides the cramped, coach-class commercial planes that many of us are accustomed to. There are the private executive jets of the extremely rich; the light prop planes of recreational pilots; the cargo fleets of UPS, Federal Express, DHL and the like; the helicopters and light planes of police departments; need I go on?; then there is, of course, the military. And within the military ”\" which sometimes seems like a world unto itself - there are also scores of different aircraft types: cargo planes, fighters, bombers, trainers, transports, spy planes. Just as the movements of commercial aircraft describe various kinds of relational space, so do the movements of military aircraft.This project is about one very peculiar subset of military aircraft ”\" a fleet of nondescript Boeing 737s and Beechcraft King Airs that use the call-sign JANET when they're operating in civilian airspace. The JANETs are an airline operating in the service of the military whose purpose is to shuttle workers to and from a collection of secret military installations in the Southwest and to undertake support operations for some of the most obscure activities within the Military Industrial Complex. The JANETs' movements represent a very peculiar kind of relational space indeed ”\" a geography of secret projects, places, and people that military and defense-industry insiders refer to as the \"black world.\"To develop this project, we've taken advantage of an unlikely contradiction in the way that this fleet of aircraft is set up. Because the JANET fleet operates under the guise of a civilian (rather than military) organization, the fleet has to obey the conventions of civilian aviation. These conventions include filing plans with the Federal Aviation Administration for each flight, and updating large files of maintenance records and registration histories with the FAA. For good reasons, these sorts of documents fall squarely in the public domain. Flight data from the JANETs, for example, is available in near-real time. To build this project, we've taken advantage of these public data sources in order to build an application that maps ”\" in close to real time ”\" the production and reproduction of the \"black world's\" secret geographies.— Trevor Paglen\\\\n\\n\\t\\n\\tUnmarked Planes and Hidden Geographies\\n\\t\\nBy Trevor Paglen\\nDesign by Craig Dietrich & Raegan KellyDesigner's StatementThe cornerstone of Unmarked Planes and Hidden Geographies is a dynamically generated map of the southwestern United States. Data collected is filtered according to predetermined fleets and each plane's flight activity from a fixed set of bases. The map engine, which started filtering data July of 2006, has produced some interesting patterns--vector logs of JANETs operating in and out of some of the large and smaller regional public airports we use. The airborne 'black world\" is clearly not restricted to the confines of secret military facilities, and can be made visible to those who know where to look.Early development research was inspired by \"Trip Mapping with PHP\" by David Sklar, author of PHP Cookbook. He outlines the necessary algorithms for converting longitude/latitude coordinates to pixels to write route lines on a map image. Unmarked Planes and Hidden Geographies expanded on these operations as we anticipated \"black world\" flight paths to North/South and East/West hemispheres, which are not supported in the original mathematical outlines.  While pixels start at (0,0) in the lower left of an image and increase into infinity to the upper right, coordinates originate from 0 in the 'middle', at Greenwich, England, and the equator, with corresponding plus and minus values. Each incoming coordinate is algorithmically converted to a plus-only pixel coordinate system and then written into the database.Flight information originates from online route data based on queries formed from Trevor's research.

Wegzeit is interested in exploring ways of representing space in an abstract sense, merging the subjective parameters of individual navigation with the broader implications of an integrated network of data.— Vectors Journal Editorial Staff\\\\n\\n\\t\\n\\tWegzeit\\n\\tThe Geometry of Relative Distance\\n\\t\\nBy Dietmar Offenhuber\\nAuthor's StatementWegzeit is my thesis project in architecture, completed in 2002. It deals with the different notions of space we use in our daily routines, and its goal is to find visual models for these subjective spaces.During my studies, I have always been more interested in aspects of the existing environment than in planning singular new buildings.  Wegzeit is also  a criticism of the traditional representation of space used used in architectural practice, the exocentric view from far above and outside, that has little in common with the spaces of our everyday experience.(You will need to install Virtools to view the entire project.)— Dietmar Offenhuber\\\\n\\n\\t\\n\\tWegzeit\\n\\tThe Geometry of Relative Distance\\n\\t\\nBy Dietmar Offenhuber\\nDesigner's StatementFrom the designer's point of view, Wegzeit is a collection of six different mapping sketches, in which I investigate the notion of 'relative space.\"In traditional maps, information is placed into an existing spatial grid with a certain scale. In my models, information is expressed only by their spatial relations; there is no grid, no scale.  The distance between two elements (rather than their physical distance) shows their relationship.(You will need to install Virtools to view the entire project.)— Vectors Journal Editorial Staff","collection":"pièces"},{"id":"wifi-bedouin--this-is-not-the-web-without-wires--","url":"http://vectorsjournal.org/projects/index.php?project=12","titre":"WiFi.Bedouin: This is not the web without wires..","personnes":"Julian Bleecker","citation":"\\n\\t\\n\\tWiFi.Bedouin\\n\\tThis is not the web without wires..\\n\\t\\nBy Julian Bleecker\\nDesign by Erik LoyerEditor's IntroductionIn his 1964 book Understanding Media, Marshall McLuhan invokes the image of a Bedouin wandering the remotest deserts by camel, dazzling the natives with media broadcasts from a battery-powered radio.

How would you draw a wired connection between two computers?  Probably with a line.  You'd draw the line, and you'd understand that it meant information could flow both ways between the two machines.How would you draw a radio broadcast?  Concentric circles or arcs, perhaps?  We've seen it a thousand times, and we know that information only travels one way across those curves.Now, how would you draw a call between wireless phones?  You might have to stop and think for a second first.  In keeping with the above-mentioned wireless tradition, you might find yourself using concentric circles again, drawing a satellite orbiting the earth as the source of a broadcast enveloping both handsets.  But those ripples generally mean one-way communication only, and so they don't seem fully adequate to account for the interactive conversation taking place between the two mobile phone users.  So, what else do we draw?We run into the same conundrum when attempting to represent wireless internet access.  It's easy to diagram the broadcast area of a wireless hotspot with some concentric rings, but what about the activity taking place within that hotspot?  What do we draw?Julian Bleecker's WiFi.Bedouin complicates the issue further, by introducing the idea of a mobile WiFi hotspot that can, among other things, intercept and redirect the traffic of web surfers attempting to reach canonical websites.  Intrigued by the way in which Julian's approach troubled our normal conceptions of wireless networks, I quickly became interested in the notion that we simply have not yet developed a popular visual vocabulary to adequately describe wireless connectivity—at least not in a way that would shed any light on people's behavior while using these networks.  Working out such a vocabulary thus became the major focus of my work on this project, which is humbly offered as a step along the way.It seemed important from the beginning to visualize wireless connectivity as a space where specific events could occur.  WiFi access points thus became sources of this interactive space, and in my early sketches this was represented with cones of light, as if the wireless hotspot functioned like an overhead lamp whose illumination made useful activity possible in a darkened room.  While this was a compelling metaphor, in the final analysis it carried too much physical baggage to be of much use.
